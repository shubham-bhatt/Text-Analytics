gooty & yammarino, 2011; yammarino & gooty, 2017) and has been the focus of numerous leadership studies (see dionne et al., 2014; gooty, serban, thomas, gavin, & yammarino, 2012; yammarino, dionne, chun, & dansereau, 2005). however, of the four levels of analysis in a typical levels framework (individual, dyad, group/team, and collective/ organization - dansereau, alutto, & yammarino, 1984), the dyad level is known as the most poorly understood level (gooty & yammarino, 2011; yammarino & gooty, 2017) and has often been ignored in mul- tilevel research (tse & ashkanasy, 2015; yammarino et al., 2005).  the major reason contributing to the lack of understanding of the dyad level is levels of analysis misalignment issues. in particular, there is an emerging consensus among organizational behavior and leader- ship scholars that when pure dyadic phenomenon is focal, it may be misleading to theorize and hypothesize at the dyad level but measure or  assess the phenomenon from only one side of the dyadic partnership (an individual-level approach, e.g., individual\\'s perceptions of the dyadic phenomenon) (gooty et al., 2012; gooty & yammarino, 2011; krasikova & lebreton, 2012; tse & ashkanasy, 2015; yammarino & gooty, 2017). pure dyadic phenomena reside conceptually and operate empirically at the dyad level (not the individual level) and can include notions such as dyad characteristics (e.g., dyadic tenure, demographic compositions), emergent properties (e.g., interaction, relationship, ex- change) shared within the dyad, quality of those emergent properties as assessed by both members, and (dis)agreement between the dyadic partners. since dyad-level phenomena are mostly emergent from the interaction between the two individuals (dyadic members or partners) (gooty & yammarino, 2011), measuring a variable of interest from solely one dyadic partner would lead to an incomplete view of the phenomenon of interest and may result in a misrepresentation of the dyadic relationship (krasikova & lebreton, 2012).  in other words, when understanding the (shared) reality of the dyadic relationship is of interest, rather than one person\\'s perception of the relationship, taking a dual perspective (paglis & green, 2002) will  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2019.101306 received 30 november 2017;

matta, scott, koopman, & conlon, 2015). the general idea of con- sidering all participating parties in the phenomenon of interest is therefore critical from a validity standpoint. it is interesting to note that this approach is regularly used in group- and team-level studies, where data are frequently collected from all group and team members. in a similar approach, when interested in pure dyadic phenomenon, re- searchers could take both dyadic partners\\' view into account and collect data from all (both) dyad members (dansereau et al., 1984; krasikova & lebreton, 2012; tse & ashkanasy, 2015; yammarino & gooty, 2017).  as these levels-of-analysis misalignment issues for the dyad level are becoming more understood and interest in applying potential remedies have increased (krasikova & lebreton, 2012; tse & ashkanasy, 2015; yammarino & gooty, 2017), we believe it is timely to review the cur- rent state-of-the-science of leader-follower dyads research. our focus in this review is to take stock of what we know and how much we know about pure leader-follower dyadic phenomena. in doing so, we generate a nomological network for leader-follower dyads research to represent current empirical findings and highlight research areas that require further attention. we limit this review to “pure” leader-follower dyadic studies (see gooty & yammarino, 2011) that align the levels of theory, measurement, analysis, and inference at the dyad level. such studies theorize a dyad-level phenomenon (e.g., dyad characteristics, emergent properties, (dis)agreement in dyads), assess at least one variable about the leader, follower, or relationship from both dyadic partners\\' per- spectives, and generate dyad-level variables by matching both dyadic partners\\' responses. as our focus is on the pure dyad level, we will not be reviewing studies that mainly examined the correlates, causes, or effects of individual-level perceptions of the relationship (e.g., follo- wer\\'s leader-member exchange (lmx) perception) (see dulebohn, bommer, liden, brouer, & ferris, 2012).  our work differs from previous reviews that incorporated leader- follower dyadic theories (e.g., dionne et al., 2014; gooty et al., 2012; krasikova & lebreton, 2012; liden, anand, & vidyarthi, 2016; sin, nahrgang, & morgeson, 2009; tse, troth, ashkanasy, & collins, 2018; yammarino et al., 2005) in that we have a specific focus on a single level of analysis (i.e., dyad level only) and yet a broader focus in terms of theories, as we are not limiting our review to lmx, one of the most studied theories on leader-follower relationship. contrary to yammarino et al. (2005)\\'s comprehensive review on leadership and levels of analysis that incorporated various leadership theories and pinpointed levels of analysis misalignment issues, we particularly focus on studies of dyad-level theories and summarize the current state of leader-follower dyads research. moreover, beyond dionne et al. (2014)\\'s more up-to-date review that examined levels of analysis in- corporation in both conceptual and empirical leadership research published only in the leadership quarterly, this review focuses explicitly on dyad-level leadership studies published in several top organizational behavior and management journals and aims to summarize leader-fol- lower dyads research in terms of theories, methods, variables, and variable dimensions.  in addition, our review differs from the extant reviews on leader- follower dyads that focus on levels-based issues only within lmx re- search (gooty et al., 2012), only with regard to methodological issues in dyads research (krasikova & lebreton, 2012), only on lmx agreement (sin et al., 2009), or only on the state of affect and lmx research from a multilevel perspective (tse et al., 2018). rather, our focus is to review pure dyad-level studies in terms of the usage of theories, methods, and variables in a broader scope. in terms of theories and variables, our  scope includes but is not limited to dyad-level lmx (tse et al., 2018) and/or lmx agreement (sin et al., 2009). with respect to pure dyadic level investigations, we also consider vertical dyad linkage (vdl, e.g., dansereau, graen, & haga, 1975), individualized leadership (e.g., dansereau et al., 1995), lmx, relational leadership theory (rlt, e.g., uhl-bien, 2006), and leader-follower congruence (e.g., kristof-brown, zimmerman, & johnson, 2005). with regard to methods, we are not focusing on raising methodological concerns but rather concentrating on understanding how each dyadic research method proposed and re- viewed elsewhere (e.g., gooty & yammarino, 2011; krasikova & lebreton, 2012) - such as multilevel modeling, polynomial regression, within and between analysis (waba), and actor-partner inter- dependence model (apim)/one-with-many model (owm) - has been utilized in leader-follower dyads studies. finally, this review is distinct from liden et al. (2016)\\'s theoretical/conceptual review, which centers on the development and nature of dyadic relationships, as we review empirical leader-follower dyads studies and concentrate on the vari- ables used in those studies to generate a nomological network for leader-follower dyads research.  in summary, we extend the findings from the aforementioned re- views, first, by capturing studies on leader-follower dyads published in multiple journal outlets; second, by including dyadic relationship-based studies not limited to only lmx theory; third, by reviewing studies that include variables of focus assessed from both dyadic partners; and fourth, by developing a nomological network relevant for leader-fol- lower dyads theory building and testing.  in the following sections, to help frame our review, we provide an overview of current theories on leader-follower dyads, suggested re- search methods for examining dyadic phenomena, and levels and di- mensionality issues regarding leader-follower dyads. to explore how specific theories and methods have been utilized to examine dyadic phenomenon, we develop targeted research questions to be addressed via comprehensive review results derived from coding pure leader-fol- lower dyads studies. ultimately, we generate a nomological network derived from key variables within existing dyad studies and present the connection among these variables to summarize the current state of leader-follower dyads research. based on review results and the pro- posed nomological network, we suggest future directions for leader- follower dyads research.  overview and research questions  theories of leader-follower dyads  we initially employed five theories (i.e., vdl, individualized leadership, lmx, relational leadership, leader-follower congruence) on leader-follower dyads or leader-follower relationships identified in a previous review by dionne et al. (2014) as the framework to categorize leader-follower dyads studies in our review. these five theories re- present leadership generally proposed as pure leader-follower dyadic relations of interest.  vertical dyad linkage (vdl) vdl challenged the assumptions of the traditional leadership ap-  proach (i.e., average leadership style, als) and explained the me- chanism of differentiated relationship development by introducing the concept of ‘negotiating latitude’ (dansereau et al., 1975; dansereau, cashman, & graen, 1973; graen, 1976). specifically, depending on the degree of the negotiating latitude within dyads, the dyadic relationship between supervisor and subordinate can be either supervision (low negotiating latitude) or leadership (high negotiating latitude) (dansereau et al., 1975). as vdl addressed a separation of in-groups and out-groups within an existing group, the level of analysis for vdl was suggested as dyads within group (see dansereau, yammarino, & markham, 1995).  empirical support for vdl showed mixed results. vdl was  j. kim, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101306  2    supported with superior-manager dyads in a public university setting (dansereau et al., 1975; liden & graen, 1980), but with different samples (rosse & kraut, 1983) and different measures of negotiating latitude and analytical methods (nachman, dansereau, & naughton, 1983), the results were inconsistent with the early studies. the con- flicting results raised questions about the validity of the negotiating latitude measure and the level of analysis of vdl.  despite these questions, vdl made a significant contribution to the field by challenging the assumption of als regarding leader-follower relationships and suggesting such relationships are often differentiated in a group context. this was a new perspective on leader-follower re- lationships that placed the ‘dyad’ as a central unit of analysis for lea- dership research. as a result, vdl became the foundation of other leader-follower dyadic relationships theories.  individualized leadership knowing that leaders form differentiated relationships with fol-  lowers, dansereau et al. (1984) provided empirical support for the level of the leader-follower relationship such that perceptions of investments and returns in the relationship were similar between the leader and follower and this pattern was replicated across all dyads with only the degree of investments and returns varying. the notion that a leader and a follower share similar perceptions but the degree of perceptions differ from dyad to dyad was further developed as individualized leadership theory (dansereau, 1995; dansereau et al., 1995; yammarino & dansereau, 2002). individualized leadership focuses on the reciprocity (i.e., investments and returns) process that makes two individuals (i.e., leader and follower) become (or emerge as) a dyad. specifically, the iterative process of exchanging support for self-worth and satisfying performance between leader and follower helps the relationship be- tween the dyadic partners to become unique and independent from other dyads and the group, and fosters the interdependence within the dyad (yammarino & dansereau, 2002).  individualized leadership has received empirical support from both quantitative and qualitative studies such that support for self-worth and satisfying performance (measured from both leader and follower per- spectives in quantitative studies) showed similarity within the dyads and differences across the dyads (dansereau et al., 1995; wallis, yammarino, & feyerherm, 2011). in other words, dyads were char- acterized as independent from other dyads and the group yet having interdependence between dyadic partners in those studies.  individualized leadership was not suggested as an alternative to als or vdl, but rather as an additional perspective on leadership by iden- tifying a relatively new relational process (i.e., investment-return cycle), and suggesting two variables (i.e., support for self-worth, sa- tisfying performance) and their association that operate at the dyad level (dansereau et al., 1995). although individualized leadership re- ceived empirical support, some questions on contextual factors (e.g., antecedents and outcomes of support for self-worth, boundary condi- tions) have been raised, resulting in calls for additional research to resolve issues and provide greater clarity to dyadic leadership concepts (ferris & harrell-cook, 1998; mumford, 1998).  leader-member exchange (lmx) lmx (graen & cashman, 1975; graen & uhl-bien, 1995) kept the  central notion of vdl – that leaders develop differentiated relationships that form in-groups/out-groups – but put more emphasis on the quality of the exchange relationship that a leader maintains with followers. a low-quality relationship was characterized as being transactional, which is close to economic exchange, whereas a high-quality relation- ship was characterized as having high trust, mutual liking, and respect, which represents social exchange (bernerth, armenakis, feild, giles, & walker, 2007). after exploring the existence of differentiated re- lationships depending on the relationship qualities, lmx has evolved to reflect a cycle of leader-follower relationship development (graen & uhl-bien, 1995).  after further development of lmx theory (for a review, see dulebohn et al., 2012), bernerth et al. (2007) introduced an additional perspective and measure (i.e., leader-member social exchange, lmsx) that concentrated on the ‘social exchange’ nature of the leader-follower exchange relationships. in other words, this additional view shifted the focus of lmx from the quality of the relationship (e.g., affect, respect) to the quality of the (social) exchange behavior in the relationship. colquitt, baer, long, and halvorsen-ganepola (2014) provided initial evidence that lmsx captures the social exchange nature of the leader- follower relationship better than other relationship related measures, including lmx-7, by examining the face validity of the measures from undergraduate (mostly not employed) students\\' viewpoint (with same- source data) and suggested that lmsx might be more appropriate to use when studying lmx and the social exchange in relationships.  while lmsx has refocused exploration on the quality of the social exchange and related behaviors, some issues remain surrounding the concept of lmx such that the level of lmx theory is unclear. although lmx was introduced conceptually as a dyad-level theory, the majority of lmx studies have been conducted at the individual level (see dionne et al., 2014; gooty et al., 2012; yammarino et al., 2005). followers\\' perception of lmx quality was mostly measured at the individual level and has been shown to be both an important predictor of an individual\\'s cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes and a mediating me- chanism that connects individual or interpersonal relationship char- acteristics and those individual outcomes (dulebohn et al., 2012; gerstner & day, 1997; ilies, nahrgang, & morgeson, 2007; rockstuhl, dulebohn, ang, & shore, 2012). measuring lmx at the individual level can be helpful when examining the cause and effect (antecedents and outcomes) of an individual\\'s relationship perceptions but may be pro- blematic when used to represent the dyadic relationship, as one in- dividual\\'s relationship perception may not be an accurate representa- tion of the relationship (gooty & yammarino, 2016; krasikova & lebreton, 2012). when an individual\\'s lmx quality perception is used as a proxy for dyadic lmx quality, and inferences are made for a dyadic phenomenon, theoretical contribution for understanding leader-fol- lower dyads may be limited.  several researchers investigated the level at which lmx operates and showed that, when properly measured and analyzed with both dyadic partners\\' perspectives, lmx can be a dyadic phenomenon (gooty & yammarino, 2011; markham, yammarino, murry, & palanski, 2010; schriesheim, castro, zhou, & yammarino, 2001). although the number of pure dyad-level lmx studies (i.e., with leader and follower both reporting about lmx and, for example, an outcome) is far less than individual-level lmx studies (e.g., follower reports about lmx per- ception and the leader reports about performance), dyad-level lmx studies are increasing recently with better measurement and analysis practices.  relational leadership relational leadership theory (rlt) (uhl-bien, 2006; uhl-bien &  ospina, 2012) highlights the importance of the relational process that enables leadership and considers leadership as a socially constructed phenomenon (yammarino, salas, serban, shirreffs, & shuffler, 2012). moreover, the relationship is considered as an outcome that is produced through the relational process (e.g., social interactions) (uhl-bien, 2006). in other words, rlt is a theory that emphasizes relational dy- namics as an organizing mechanism and views the relationship as an outcome.  as the major focus of rlt is on understanding the process of re- lationship development, qualitative research methods (e.g., organiza- tional discourse analysis) have been suggested as a suitable in- vestigative approach (fairhurst & uhl-bien, 2012; uhl-bien, 2006; uhl- bien & ospina, 2012). rlt has been further advanced through applying diverse disciplinary perspectives and contexts (see uhl-bien & ospina, 2012) and mixed methods (e.g., meinecke, lehmann-willenbrock, & kauffeld, 2017) to capture, for example, the relational dynamics in  j. kim, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101306  3    leader-follower dyadic communication patterns. the focal relationship in rlt, however, is not limited to leader-  follower relationship but includes all possible forms of relationships within organizations (uhl-bien, 2006). in terms of levels, rlt involves dyads, but goes beyond and includes groups and collectives. although rlt does not directly or solely focus on dyadic phenomenon, the the- ory\\'s relational process orientation can be used as a framework to un- derstand dyadic relationship development and procedural antecedents of relational outcomes. in particular, rlt provides insight to investigate issues such as the factors affecting relationship development, the as- sociations among factors to build an emerging dyadic relationship, and patterns of social interactions in the relationships.  leader-follower congruence congruence involves matching two conceptually distinct constructs  and can be presented with different terms such as fit, similarity, match, or agreement (edwards, 1994). leader-follower congruence is one type of person-environment fit, considering the leader as the environment for the follower and vice versa (kristof-brown et al., 2005). depending on the measure, congruence can be categorized into subjective (i.e., perceived) and objective (i.e., actual) congruence (caplan, 1987; kristof, 1996). while subjective congruence considers an individual\\'s (e.g., follower\\'s) belief about whether he/she fits well with the en- vironment (e.g., leader), objective congruence involves explicit com- parison of the follower\\'s and the leader\\'s characteristics or perceptions, measured from both independently (e.g., cogliser, schriesheim, scandura, & gardner, 2009; sin et al., 2009). needs-supplies fit and demands-abilities fit (caplan, 1987; kristof, 1996) have also been considered at the dyad level to predict followers\\' individual outcomes (e.g., marstand, martin, & epitropaki, 2017).  leader-follower congruence has gained empirical support in pre- dicting various individual outcomes. kristof-brown et al. (2005)\\'s meta- analysis showed that leader-follower fit (e.g., value, goal, personality), including both subjective and objective fit, is positively related to in- dividual outcomes such as job satisfaction, supervisor satisfaction, and lmx. additionally, relational demography (tsui & o\\'reilly, 1989), which considers the similarity and dissimilarity of demographic char- acteristics (e.g., race, gender, education level, job tenure), was pre- sented as a dyad-level variable that predicts individual outcomes. the association between (dis)similarity in individual characteristics in dyads and individual outcomes provides an understanding of how in- dividuals are influenced by having a better/worse matched partner. this research framework can be extended by employing dyad-level outcomes and provide an additional understanding of leader-follower dyadic relationships.  summary leader-follower dyadic phenomena have been viewed from diverse  theoretical perspectives that fall into the general domain of leadership or leader-follower relationships. each theory views the dyadic phe- nomena from different levels-of-analysis perspectives and captures the dyadic phenomena differently by focusing on either process or out- comes. individualized leadership emphasizes the investment-return cycle as a key process to build interdependence in the dyad, whereas rlt focuses on the dynamic nature of the relationship development process. on the other hand, lmx concentrates on high quality re- lationship outcomes, and leader-follower congruence considers the outcomes of (mis)match between two individuals\\' characteristics. given the different foci, each theory provides a foundation for different re- search questions on leader-follower dyadic phenomena. moreover, it is possible that theories other than these five theories could have been used to examine different aspects of leader-follower dyads.  to understand how much the dyad- and/or relationship-related theories in leadership have been employed and what other theories have been used in leader-follower dyads studies since the beginning of dyads studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of  leader-follower dyads research and identify theories that have been (under)utilized in leader-follower dyads studies, we propose the fol- lowing research question on the usage of each theory in leader-follower dyads research.  research question 1(rq1). what is the current usage of dyad the- ories to explain the leader-follower dyadic phenomenon? which theories are used, to what degree, and how are they formulated to account for pure dyadic phenomenon?  dyadic research methods  analyzing dyadic data with appropriate dyadic research methods and techniques requires specification of the type of dyads involved (gooty & yammarino, 2011; krasikova & lebreton, 2012; tse et al., 2018). for example, failure to include group membership as a group- level variable when dyads are embedded in groups could result in in- accurate examination of dyadic phenomena. specifically, dyadic data can be collected from either independent dyads (i.e., one leader and one follower) or dependent dyads (i.e., one leader and multiple followers in a group) (see gooty & yammarino, 2011). as the importance of con- sidering data dependencies in dyadic analyses has been emphasized in previous research (gooty & yammarino, 2011; krasikova & lebreton, 2012; tse et al., 2018), we examine whether the type of dyads has been considered in the leader-follower dyads research by addressing research question below:  research question 2a (rq2a). do leader-follower dyad studies focus on independent or dependent dyads and how is the focus typically justified?  several specific methods have been suggested for testing theoretical notions about leader-follower dyads and analyzing data collected from both dyadic partners (see gooty & yammarino, 2011; krasikova & lebreton, 2012; liden et al., 2016; yammarino & gooty, 2017). the usage of these available methods depends on the research questions, and certain questions may require the use of more than one of these primary methods summarized below.  multilevel modeling when a research question involves contemporary cross-level effects  (see yammarino & gooty, 2019) – such as a direct relationship between a higher-level independent variable and a lower-level dependent vari- able, or a moderating effect of a higher-level independent variable on a lower-level independent-dependent variable relationship – multilevel (random coefficient) modeling can be implemented through several software platforms (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling (hlm), r, stata, and mplus). when implementing a dyad-level variable as an in- dependent variable, both dyadic partners\\' individual responses need to be included and aggregated (see gooty & yammarino, 2011).  multilevel modeling can specify the types of dyads that enable re- searchers to study both independent and dependent dyads in organi- zations. in addition, multilevel modeling can address research questions involving (contemporary) cross-level interactions by including higher- level moderators in the model. another strength of multilevel modeling comes from having an individual-level dependent variable; this allows for the examination of research questions pertaining to the effect of dyad-level predictors on individual outcomes. when the phenomenon of interest is a (contemporary) cross-level relationship, then multilevel modeling is a suitable method to use. however, when the phenomenon of interest involves a higher-level (e.g., dyad-level) dependent variable, multilevel modeling might not be applicable.  polynomial regression polynomial regression and response surface methodology (edwards  & parry, 1993; shanock, baran, gentry, pattison, & heggestad, 2010) have been introduced as alternatives to difference scores when ex- amining the effect of similarity, congruence, fit, and/or the match be- tween two entities or notions. as a dyad involves two individuals, polynomial regression could be a suitable method for studying the  j. kim, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101306  4    effects of convergence and divergence of two individuals\\' perceptions (liden et al., 2016) or the effects of similarity and dissimilarity of two individuals\\' characteristics on individual outcomes (e.g., zhang, wang, & shi, 2012). after fitting the polynomial regression model, regression coefficients, covariances, and standard errors are used to estimate the response surface which visually shows the effects of convergence and divergence (shanock et al., 2010). by examining the slope and curva- ture of the congruence and incongruence lines of the estimated re- sponse surface, research questions on the similarity, congruence, fit, or match can be investigated. in addition, nonindependence of dyads can be considered by employing cross-level polynomial regression (jansen & kristof-brown, 2005).  although polynomial regression is a useful tool to study the effect of congruence and/or divergence of the predictor on individual outcomes, this method cannot be directly implemented when examining dyad- level outcomes. the additional step of aggregating the two individuals\\' outcomes to generate a dyad-level variable is necessary to study dyadic phenomenon.  within and between analysis (waba) waba is useful for testing the level of analysis of variables (waba  i), the relationship between the variables (waba ii), and traditional cross-level effects (dansereau et al., 1984; gooty & yammarino, 2011; schriesheim et al., 2001; yammarino & dubinsky, 1992; yammarino & gooty, 2019). contrary to other dyadic data analysis methods that allow dependent variables to only be at the individual level, waba can be used when the dependent variable is a dyad-level variable. waba uses anova and correlation-based procedures to make inferences about the level(s) of variables and relationships between the variables and whether there are traditional cross-level effects (dansereau et al., 1984; yammarino, 1998; yammarino & gooty, 2017, 2019).  waba is a tool to test the theoretically driven level of variables and relationships of interest. the strength of waba is that it can consider different types of dyads (i.e., independent, dependent), test multi-level effects (e.g., dyad-level predictor – dyad-level outcomes), and employ dyad-level outcomes in the model. waba can be challenging when the phenomenon of interest is complex, involving multiple mediators and moderators simultaneously in analyses (see gooty & yammarino, 2011; yammarino & gooty, 2017), but advanced waba procedures can be employed to overcome this limitation (see dansereau et al., 1984; schriesheim, 1995; yammarino, 1998).  actor-partner interdependence model (apim)/one with many (owm) model  apim and owm models were initially suggested for dyadic analyses of interpersonal and romantic relationships (kenny, kashy, & cook, 2006). the use of each model depends on whether the dyads are in- dependent (i.e., apim) or dependent (i.e., owm) (kenny et al., 2006; krasikova & lebreton, 2012). apim requires both independent and dependent variables to be collected from both dyadic partners and could address research questions on how each dyadic partners\\' char- acteristics influence himself/herself and the dyadic partner (i.e., mutual influence) and can examine the relative strength of each effect (krasikova & lebreton, 2012). owm can be employed for dependent  dyads that involve multiple relationships of an individual. owm en- compasses the actor effect, partner effect, and relationship effect and allows researchers to examine whether the reciprocity between the actor and partner are generalized among or unique to dyads (krasikova & lebreton, 2012).  apim/owm, depending on the type of dyads being studied, can simultaneously investigate interpersonal and intrapersonal effects. the independent and dependent variables should both be matched data (i.e., obtained from both actor and partner) from the dyad. when running the model, the independent variable and dependent variable are not aggregated to one value that represents the dyads, but each individual\\'s response is used separately. apim/owm can examine how a dyad member can impact his/her relationship partner, but unique characteristics of the dyad or the effect of the combination of two in- dividuals\\' characteristics cannot be examined through this method.  summary various methods that have different foci and involve different levels  of variables have been suggested for dyadic data analysis (see table 1). based on the research questions or hypotheses, methods could be used alone, jointly, or sequentially (see yammarino & gooty, 2019).  to understand how these four dyadic data analysis methods have been employed and explore what other methods have been used to study leader-follower dyads, our review results will be summarized by focusing on the below research question:  research question 2b (rq2b). what dyadic research methods have been used, and to what degree, in leader-follower dyad studies? how are they formulated and used to account for pure dyads?  antecedents and outcomes of leader-follower dyads  studies on leader-follower relationships have been scattered in terms of theoretical basis and levels of analysis (e.g., individual level and dyad level). for instance, currently what is known about leader- follower exchange relationships is mainly based on individual-level studies (e.g., individual lmx perceptions) such that several meta-ana- lyses were conducted to show the antecedents, consequences, and correlates of individual-level lmx perceptions (dulebohn et al., 2012; dulebohn, wu, & liao, 2017; gerstner & day, 1997), but dyad-level lmx has received relatively little attention in the reviews which led to limited understanding of dyadic exchange relationships. in terms of dyad-level studies, leader-follower congruence studies were conducted at the dyad level and predicted the impact of dyad characteristics (e.g., relational demography, personality similarity) on diverse individual outcomes (e.g., tsui & o\\'reilly, 1989; zhang et al., 2012). in- dividualized leadership studies were also conducted at the dyad level by examining the relationship between support for self-worth and sa- tisfying performance, both measured at the dyad level (dansereau et al., 1995).  given the possibility of examining diverse levels of analysis in leader-follower dyads studies, it would be beneficial to review and summarize the pure leader-follower dyads studies. accordingly, we re- view studies that aligned the levels of theory, measurement, and ana- lysis at the dyad level (i.e., interested in dyadic phenomenon, collected  table 1 summary of dyadic research methods.  method objective/research question dependent/independent

research methods) to understand the antecedents and consequences of pure leader-follower dyadic phenomena.  to capture the current state of leader-follower dyads research, there is value in generating a nomological network (cronbach & meehl, 1955) that integrates previous research findings. in particular, a no- mological network will show the unique characteristics of leader-fol- lower dyads, and antecedents and consequences of those leader-fol- lower dyads characteristics. as a result, the nomological network generated in this review will depict what we currently know about leader-follower dyads. therefore, we propose the research question below:  research question 3 (rq3). what does the nomological network of leader-follower dyads look like? what are the key antecedents and con- sequences for leader-follower dyads, and are these dyadic level-focused or individual differences-focused precursors and consequences?  in addition, the multidimensionality of leader-follower dyadic phenomenon could be considered as different dimensions capturing different aspects/characteristics of the dyad. cognition, affect, and behavior dimensions have been widely used when studying groups/ teams (e.g., kozlowski & ilgen, 2006), and these dimensions are ap- plicable to dyads as a dyad is a unique/special form of a group. dyads can have shared perceptions, affective states, and behavioral patterns, meaning that outcomes of dyadic interaction can be categorized into these dimensions.  for example, the lmx construct has been known to be multi- dimensional as different measures capture different aspects of the dyadic exchange relationship (liden, wu, cao, & wayne, 2016; schriesheim, castro, & cogliser, 1999). lmx-7 (graen & uhl-bien, 1995) appears to capture the cognitive aspect of a relationship by asking how the working relationship is perceived. lmx-mdm (liden & maslyn, 1998) measures affect, loyalty, contribution, and professional respect that appear to be a mix of affective, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of the relationship. moreover, lmsx (bernerth et al., 2007) focuses on the (social) exchanging behavior that takes place within the dyad. as such, for lmx and other dyadic phenomena, different mea- sures capturing different aspects of leader-follower relationships raises the possibility of the multidimensional nature of dyadic phenomena. in addition, given that outcomes of leader-follower relationships can be categorized as affect, behavior, or cognition (dulebohn et al., 2012; gerstner & day, 1997; ilies et al., 2007; rockstuhl et al., 2012), it would be worth examining the dimensions of the outcomes of dyads or dyadic relationships as well. therefore, we propose:  research question 4 (rq4). what is the dimensionality (i.e., affec- tive, behavioral, and cognitive) of variables in leader-follower dyads studies?  literature review method  to explore the above research questions and conduct a compre- hensive review of leader-follower dyads research, studies focusing on the leader-follower dyads were identified through abstract keyword searches from web-based databases (business source ultimate, psychinfo, psycharticles). the search, as in prior studies, was constrained to high-quality peer-reviewed journals in management, applied psychology, and leadership published until august 2017. from the clarivate analytics web of science 2016 impact factor list (category: management; psychology, applied), we filtered journals with impact factor> 2.0 and sorted journals that publish empirical work on micro organizational behavior phenomena. journal search based on the im- pact factor yielded 24 journals. in addition to these 24 journals, we included two journals (i.e., group & organization management; journal of leadership & organization studies) in our review that have been in- cluded in previous reviews on leadership (fischer, dietz, & antonakis, 2017; gooty et al., 2012). a full list of journals and the number of articles included in the current review by journal is presented in table 2.  keywords used in the search were based on leader-follower dyad theories (i.e., ‘vertical dyad linkage’, ‘individualized leadership’, ‘leader-member exchange’/‘lmx’, ‘relational leadership’). for lmx, the keyword ‘dyad*’ was combined to specify the level because lmx has been theoretically suggested (graen & uhl-bien, 1995) and empirically tested at multiple levels and not limited to the dyad level (gooty et al., 2012). we conducted a search with broader keyword phrases ‘leader* & dyad*’, ‘superior* & dyad*’, ‘supervisor* & dyad*’, and ‘manager* & dyad*’ to search articles that focused on leader-follower congruence, as different terms are used to represent congruence (e.g., fit, similarity, congruence, agreement), and to capture articles that are based on theories other than five initial theories discussed above.  as empirical studies on leader-follower dyads are the focus of this review, only quantitative studies on leader-follower dyads in workplace were included. specifically, for quantitative studies on leader-follower dyads, only studies that measured at least one variable from both members of the dyad were included. conceptual work, qualitative studies, meta-analyses, literature reviews, lab experiments, student samples studies, and scale development studies were excluded, as they did not fit our inclusion criteria to explore our research questions.  initial keyword searches from the journals yielded 435 articles. inclusion criteria were applied to screen the initial searched articles. abstracts and method sections of all articles were examined to de- termine the final set of articles to be coded (see fig. 1 for article screening process). after the screening, 356 out of 435 articles were excluded. these 356 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria because they were either (a) conceptual (24 articles), (b) meta-analysis/litera- ture review (12 articles), (c) scale development/construct validation (four articles), (d) qualitative studies (six articles), (e) empirical studies not specifically focused on leader-follower dyads (71 articles), (f) lab experiments/simulation (13 articles), (g) student sample studies (seven articles), (h) individual-level studies on leader-follower dyads (i.e., all variables were collected at the individual level) (194 articles), or (i) empirical studies that focused on leader-follower dyads and collected dyadic data but did not match dyadic data and used the data for se- parate individual-level analyses only (25 articles). thus, 79 articles remained to be coded.  coding process  coder training  four coders with doctoral-level training in organizational behavior and

themselves with the coding scheme and process. the training was conducted in two phases. in the first phase, coders coded ten articles individually and met to compare the results. if any discrepancies were found, coders discussed differences to reach an agreement and a consensus code. in the second practice session, four coders were split into two pairs. after individually coding another 10 articles, coders met their partner to discuss the coding results and reach an agreement. after discussing within each pair, all coders met to review results that were agreed upon within the pairs. from this discussion, coders were able to cross-check the results between coding pairs. after the two complete practice sessions, all coders coded all 79 articles by following the process of coding in- dependently, discussing the results with a partner, and checking the results with the other pair.  coding scheme  descriptive information about the articles such as authors, journal, and year of publication were recorded. all variables in the studies were recorded and the types of variables and relationships between the variables were specified. this information was used to answer rq3 on  the nomological network of leader-follower dyads. the theoretical basis of the studies, the type of dyads from which the study collected data, and the analytic methods were coded to answer rq1, rq2a, and rq2b, respectively. for studies that used theories and methods other than the five theories and four primary methods discussed above, coders used an ‘other’ code and noted the name of the other theories and methods. in addition, studies that used multiple theories or methods were given multiple codes. to answer rq4, all variables included in the hypotheses involving dyadic variables were considered, and levels and dimensions (i.e., affect, behavior, cognition, and demographics) of these variables were coded. for example, when a variable was measured from both the leader\\'s and follower\\'s perspectives and combined, the level of the variable was coded as ‘dyad’. on the other hand, when the variable was measured from either leader or follower, but not both, the level of the variable was coded as ‘individual’. dimensions of each variable were coded as affect, behavior, cognition, or demographics based on the conceptualization.  results  seventy-nine articles included in

quarterly 31 (2020) 101306  7    of leader-follower dyads studies that include a dyad-level variable has been increasing continuously.  rq 1 results  a summary of leader-follower dyad articles by theory is presented in table 3. forty-six articles used one of the five theories reviewed above (presented on the diagonal of theory code 1 to 5 in table 3), six articles used one or multiple other theories (presented on the diagonal of theory code 6), and 27 articles used either a combination of one of the five theories and other theories or a combination of two of the five theories to explain the phenomenon of interest (presented on the off- diagonal of table 3). among the 46 articles that used one theory, leader-follower congruence (35 articles) was the most used theory for leader-follower dyad studies, followed by lmx (five articles), in- dividualized leadership (three articles), and vdl (three articles).  studies on leader-follower congruence mainly focused on in- vestigating the effect of similarity/dissimilarity of leader-follower characteristics (e.g., demographics, individual characteristics) (e.g., pearce & xu, 2012; tsui & o\\'reilly, 1989) or a leader\\'s and a follower\\'s perceptions (e.g., greene, 1972; wexley & pulakos, 1983). specifically, among the 35 articles, 19 articles (54%) studied the effects of demo- graphic similarity. studies on lmx examined the antecedents or con- sequences of dyadic lmx (e.g., olsson, hemlin, & pousette, 2012; schriesheim et al., 2001). studies on individualized leadership con- centrated on testing the levels of support for self-worth and satisfying performance (e.g., keller & dansereau, 1995). vdl studies investigated an antecedent of vdl quality (snyder & bruning, 1985) and con- sequences of negotiation latitude (kozlowski & doherty, 1989; rosse & kraut, 1983).  six articles that were based on other theories employed transfor- mational leadership, contingent reward leadership, relational control approach, or social exchange theory. regarding transformational  leadership and contingent reward leadership, the level of the theory and the level of the relationship between leadership behavior and outcomes were investigated (e.g., yammarino, dubinsky, comer, & jolson, 1997). relational control approach was used to examine the dyadic conversation pattern (courtright, fairhurst, & rogers, 1989), and social exchange theory was applied to develop an idea on the effect of a leader and a follower\\'s commitment interaction on follower\\'s job performance (landry & vandenberghe, 2012).  regarding the 27 articles that applied two theories, 20 articles were related to both leader-follower congruence and lmx and examined the effect of a leader\\'s and a follower\\'s individual differences congruence on individual lmx perceptions (e.g., byza, schuh, dörr, spörrle, & maier, 2017; tsai et al., 2017) or the effect of lmx agreement on a follower\\'s outcomes (e.g., matta et al., 2015). four articles combined leader-fol- lower congruence and other theories (e.g., transformational leadership, guanxi), two articles used lmx and other theories (e.g., transforma- tional leadership, resource dependence theory), and one article was based on vdl and individualized leadership.  summary the results showed that the majority of the studies concentrated on  leader-follower congruence or lmx and predicted outcomes of the leader-follower relationship. in contrast, studies that used process-or- iented theories, such as individualized leadership and relational lea- dership theory, were relatively limited. interestingly, several other theories such as transformational leadership and contingent reward leadership were applied to study leader-follower dyadic phenomenon.  rq 2a results  the type of dyads assessed or used in each study is summarized in table 4. studies were coded as operationalizing the dyads as in- dependent dyads when the number of leaders and followers in the sample were identical, and as dependent dyads when dyad data were collected from groups/teams and the number of leaders and followers were different (i.e., a leader had multiple followers). for dependent dyads studies, we coded whether the nested nature of the data was considered in the analyses. studies that did not report the number of both leaders and followers were coded as not specifying the type of dyads.  of 79 articles, 19 articles specified that dyadic data were collected from independent dyads, 41 articles were based on data collected from dependent dyads, 17 articles (22%) did not specify the type of dyads used in the study, and two articles conducted multiple studies with different operationalizations. for example, guarana and barnes (2017) collected data from independent dyads for the first study and from dependent dyads for the second study; and paustian-underdahl, king, rogelberg, kulich, and gentry (2017) did not provide adequate in- formation to discern the type of dyads in one study and collected de- pendent dyad data in the other study. regarding the 43 articles that used data from dependent dyads, including two articles that  fig. 2.

teams.  the 27 articles used different methods to take the group-level effects into consideration. waba was used to directly test whether the levels of the relationship of interest were at the dyad or group level (e.g., yammarino & dubinsky, 1994). some studies used aggregation tests (i.e., icc) to either eliminate the possibility of group-level effect (e.g., tsai et al., 2017) or aggregate a group-level variable (e.g., colbert, kristof-brown, bradley, & barrick, 2008). in the case of studies em- ploying multilevel modeling, variables related to leaders were included as group-level variables to either control the nesting of dyads under a common leader or explain group-level effects (e.g., guarana & barnes, 2017; kant, skogstad, torsheim, & einarsen, 2013).  summary as independent dyads (i.e., one leader and one follower) and de-  pendent dyads (i.e., one leader and multiple followers) are conceptually distinct, and have the potential to involve different levels of analysis (gooty & yammarino, 2011), the type of dyads included in the study needs to be specified and the requisite proper methodological attention should be given to the specified dyadic type (tse et al., 2018). although most studies discussed the type of dyads, some studies failed to specify this explicitly. moreover, among the studies that collected data from dependent dyads, approximately one third of the studies did not con- sider the nesting of dyads within a group. the results suggest room for improvement in specifying the type of dyads and implementing meth- odological rigor when studying dependent dyads.  rq 2b results  a summary of leader-follower dyad articles by method is shown in table 5. twenty-six articles used one of the four dyadic research methods (i.e., multilevel modeling, polynomial regression/response surface methodology, waba, apim/owm) reviewed above (presented on the diagonal of method code 1 to 4 in table 5), eight articles used either a combination of one of the four methods and other methods or a combination of two of the four methods (presented on the off-diagonal of table 5), and 45 articles used other methods (presented on the di- agonal of method code 5 in table 5).  among the 26 articles that used one of the four methods, multilevel modeling and waba (nine articles each) were the most used method, followed by polynomial regression (seven articles), and apim/owm (one article). multilevel modeling was used to consider both dyad-level effects and group-level effects, such as group phenomenon (e.g., chun, cho, & sosik, 2016) or leader-specific effects in groups (e.g., triana, richard, & yücel, 2017). waba was employed to test whether the variables and associations of interest operated at the dyad level (e.g., markham, markham, & smith, 2015). polynomial regression was im- plemented in studies that focused on the effect of congruence and  incongruence of a leader\\'s and a follower\\'s characteristics/perceptions (e.g., matta et al., 2015).  regarding the eight articles that used at least one of the four re- viewed methods and another method, two articles that used multilevel modeling conducted waba as an additional test for levels of the phe- nomenon of interest (douglas, 2012; gooty & yammarino, 2016), one article that conducted structural equation modeling used waba to justify aggregation of the variable of interest (clarke & mahadi, 2017), two articles that employed waba as a primary method used additional methods such as structural equation modeling (dansereau et al., 1995) and correlations (keller & dansereau, 1995), two articles that applied polynomial regression used either multilevel modeling to eliminate the possibility of group-level effects when using dependent dyad data (tsai et al., 2017) or structural equation modeling for mediation tests (colbert et al., 2008), and one article that had two studies employed regression and multilevel regression for each study (paustian- underdahl et al., 2017).  other methods used in the 45 articles were multiple linear regres- sion (21 articles), anova/manova (10 articles), structural equation modeling/path analysis (five articles), correlation (four articles), a mix of these methods (e.g., correlation and regression, anova and re- gression) (three articles), grizzle, starmer, and koch (gsk) approach (one article) (courtright et al., 1989), and simon-blalock technique (one article) (greene & organ, 1973). studies using multiple linear regression used difference scores to represent dyad characteristics (e.g., tsui & o\\'reilly, 1989), and studies using anova/manova employed categories of dyads to examine the difference in the outcomes of in- terest (e.g., sherman, kennedy, woodard, & mccomb, 2012).  summary less than a half of the articles (34 out of 79 articles) used at least  one of the methods reviewed here, and the rest of the articles used other methods such as multiple regression and anova/manova. among the four reviewed dyadic research methods, when used either sepa- rately or in some combination, waba was the most utilized method and apim/owm (kenny et al., 2006) was the least utilized method. the low usage of apim/owm may be due to its relatively recent introduction compared to the other methods (i.e., multilevel modeling, waba, polynomial regression). given that apim/owm can explain various research questions about dyads (for sample research questions, see krasikova & lebreton, 2012; tse et al., 2018), more attention is needed to this method.  rq 3 results  in total, 224 hypotheses that included at least one dyad-level vari- able were coded and 132 hypotheses received empirical support. based on the supported hypotheses for direct and indirect effects, we gener- ated a nomological network of leader-follower dyads research as shown in figs. 3, 4, and 5.  three clusters emerged in the nomological network and each cluster included different set of theories. the first cluster (fig. 3) included core variables of vdl (i.e., negotiation latitude), lmx, and leader-follower congruence; the second cluster (fig. 4) was based on vdl and in- dividualized leadership (i.e., support for self-worth, satisfying perfor- mance); and the third cluster (fig. 5) was composed of variables studied using other leadership theories (e.g., transformational leadership, contingent reward leadership).  in fig. 3, leader-follower (in)congruence was central, as it predicted numerous individual-level, both leader-related and follower-related, outcomes. leader-follower (in)congruence variables were further cate- gorized as demographics/individual differences (e.g., race, gender, personality, competence), cognition- (e.g., relational schema, role per- ceptions), affect- (e.g., anger, affectivity), and behavior- (e.g., conflict resolution strategy) based variables. among the four categories, affect- and behavior-based variables were less studied compared to  table 5 summary

either direct or indirect effects, affect-based variables only had direct effects on outcomes (e.g., individual-level lmx, in-role behavior). several mediators were iden- tified for the relationship between leader-follower congruence and follower-related individual-level outcomes (e.g., in-role behavior, extra- role behavior, job satisfaction, trust, commitment) and follower-rated lmx was one of the mediators.  regarding lmx at the dyad level, two different approaches emerged in the nomological network. the first approach, which was examining the effect of lmx agreement (i.e., congruence) between a leader and a follower (e.g., markham et al., 2010; matta et al., 2015; sherman et al., 2012), appeared in the first cluster (fig. 3). as this approach reflects the congruence between a leader\\'s and a follower\\'s perception, it was ca- tegorized under cognition-based leader-follower congruence. lmx  agreement predicted perceived performance at the dyad level, a follo- wer\\'s work engagement, extra-role behavior, and turnover intention.  the second approach to study lmx at the dyad level, which was generating a dyad-level lmx score as an aggregate of leader-rated and follower-rated lmx, appeared in the third cluster (fig. 5). this ag- gregated lmx score was used to mediate the effect of individual-fo- cused transformational leadership occurring at the dyad level and fol- lower\\'s in-role and extra-role behavior (chun et al., 2016) and the relationship between the leader\\'s emotional intelligence and follower- related outcomes such as psychological well-being and turnover in- tention (clarke & mahadi, 2017).  fig. 4 was formulated around vdl and individualized leadership. different dyad-level variables were present and the relationships among the variables were either causal or based on covariations (keller & dansereau, 1995; markham et al., 2015; yammarino & dubinsky, 1992).  fig. 3. note: (i): individual level; (d): dyad level;

(2012)\\'s review on levels issue in lmx research, despite lmx being one of the most studied leader-follower dyadic phenomena, relatively little is known about dyad-level lmx.  rq 4 results  variables investigated in leader-follower dyads studies can be ca- tegorized into either variables that represent characteristics of dyads (i.e., dyad-level variables) or outcome variables operating at levels other than dyad level. a list of dyad-level variables and dimensions of each variable is presented in table 6, and a list of outcome variables and dimension of each variable is summarized in table 7. dimensions  were determined based on the conceptualization of each variable and coded as affect, behavior, cognition, or demographics.  in total, 50 dyad-level variables were identified. among the iden- tified variables, 44 variables were used as one type of variable with 25 variables as an independent variable, 7 variables as a moderator, one variable as a mediator, and 11 variables as a dependent variable. six variables were used as multiple types of variables and, among them, three variables were used as both an independent variable and a de- pendent variable.  regarding the dimensions of the variables, 34 out of 50 were based on cognition. the majority of cognition-based variables were related to (dis)similarity or (in)congruence between two individuals\\' character- istics (e.g., competence, growth-need strength, social cynicism, rela- tional schema, implicit leadership theory) or perceptions of particular target such as relationship quality (i.e., lmx), role, or performance rating. seventeen variables were conceptually related to behavior oc- curring within dyads such as attention, building and mending re- lationship, leadership behavior, support for self-worth, and perfor- mance (i.e., considering both a subordinate\\'s performance and a supervisor\\'s effectiveness). of the 10 variables categorized as affect variables, except (dis)similarity or (in)congruence of anger, emotional irritation, and emotional intelligence between a leader and a follower, all variables were conceptually a mix of the affective aspect and cog- nitive aspect such as lmx, satisfaction, and commitment. four variables were identified as capturing relatively objective characteristics such as demographics (e.g., race, gender, education level), dyadic tenure, re- lationship type, and guanxi as a former relationship type between a leader and a follower.  individual-level outcomes studied in leader-follower dyads studies (table 7) were categorized into follower-related outcomes and leader- related outcomes. forty-two variables were identified as follower-re- lated outcomes. in terms of the conceptual dimensions of the follower- related outcomes, cognition (27 variables) was the most studied aspect, followed by behavior (13 variables) and affect (nine variables). among the follower-related outcomes, nine variables (e.g., organizational commitment, job satisfaction, trust) were considered to be capturing multiple aspects (e.g., affect and cognition, behavior and cognition).  regarding leader-related outcomes, 18 variables were found and behavior (12 variables) was the most studied dimension, followed by affect (six variables) and cognition (five variables). among the leader- related outcomes, four variables (e.g., managerial support, leader ef- fectiveness) were a mix of multiple dimensions (e.g., affect and  fig. 5. note.

liden et al., 2016), lmx research (e.g., gooty et al., 2012; tse et al., 2018), and lmx agreement (e.g., sin et al., 2009), the current review broadly examined empirical findings in leader-follower dyads research with consideration of both theories and methods em- ployed in leader-follower dyads studies. given our focus on pure dyads studies, we excluded individual-level relationship perceptions studies (e.g., all variables are at the individual level). articles that met the inclusion criteria were coded to address research questions on the theoretical basis of each study, the usage of dyadic research methods, the nomological network of leader-follower dyadic phenomena, and the  table 6 dimensions of dyad-level variables used in leader-follower dyads research.  typea variable dimensions  affect behavior cognition demographics  iv attention x iv building and mending relationship x x iv contingent reward leadership x iv, mod (in)congruence – demographics x iv (in)congruence – affective commitment x x iv (in)congruence – anger x iv (in)congruence – cognitive moral development x iv (in)congruence – commitment - other x x iv (in)congruence – communication style x x iv (in)congruence – competence x iv (in)congruence – emotional intelligence x iv (in)congruence – growth-need strength x iv (in)congruence – political skills x iv (in)congruence – power x iv (in)congruence – personality x x x iv (in)congruence – regulatory focus x iv (in)congruence – social cynicism x iv (in)congruence – relational schema x iv (in)congruence – implicit leadership theory x iv, mod, dv (in)congruence – lmx perception x x x iv (in)congruence – attribution conflict x iv, med, dv (in)congruence – role, job content perception x iv, dv (in)congruence – other perception x iv guanxi x iv, mod interaction/relationship type x iv interpersonal problems x x iv job latitude x iv job congruence x iv, med lmx x x iv support for self-worth x x iv transformational leadership x med (in)congruence – goal importance x mod (in)congruence – emotional irritation x mod (in)congruence – meaning of work x mod (in)congruence – self-efficacy x mod (in)congruence – individual characteristics x mod dyadic tenure x mod role clarity x mod role conflict x dv commitment x x dv conflict (in conversations) x dv conflict resolution strategy x dv discussion (in conversations) x dv dyadic problems x dv (in)congruence – performance ratings x dv influence tactics x dv performance x x dv satisfaction x x dv satisfying performance x x dv subordinate\\'s extra effort x total 50 10 17 34 4  note. a iv: independent variable;

anova/ manova) by employing more contemporary methods suggested for dyadic research, when applicable.  in general, to expand our understanding of leader-follower dyads, future studies on leader-follower dyads should pay closer attention to the levels of theory, measurement, analysis, and inference, as suggested by other reviews on levels of analysis issues in leadership research (e.g., dionne et al., 2014; gooty et al., 2012; yammarino et al., 2005). ad- ditionally, future research can align the levels issues at the dyad level by addressing research questions on areas that have gained limited interest in the nomological network of leader-follower dyads and em- ploy dyad-level analysis with matched data collected from both leaders and followers.  based on the findings of the current review, we can summarize when it is necessary to consider both the leader\\'s and follower\\'s per- spective and make suggestions in terms of future research questions and methods to further develop the areas that received limited attention in leader-follower dyads research. for example, it is important to take a dyadic perspective when researchers are interested in dyadic phe- nomena such as:  1. interaction process, reciprocity, and/or exchange between a leader and a follower;  2. the interplay of a leader\\'s and a follower\\'s individual characteristics; 3. the agreement/disagreement between a leader\\'s and a follower\\'s  perceptions; and. 4. emergent properties, components, and characteristics of dyadic re-  lationships.  additionally, sample research questions that can be addressed by  table 7 dimensions of individual-level outcome variables in leader-follower dyads re- search.  leader/follower variable dimensions  affect behavior cognition other  follower attitude x x belief in unionism x commitment x x dependability x developmental activities  x  dominance x employee self- development  x  equity perception x extra-role behavior (e.g., ocb)  x  idea generation x influence in decision making  x  ingratiation x x in-role behavior (e.g., task performance, creative performance)  x  intent to remain x job burnout x job satisfaction x x level in the organization  x  lmx x x loyalty to supervisor  x  met expectation x nurturance x organizational commitment  x x  perception of control  x  perception of fairness  x  performance (rating)  x  procedural justice x psychological well- being  x x  quality of communication  x  responsibility to the union  x  role ambiguity x role conflict x salary x satisfaction with the supervisor  x x  talk time x trust x x turnover (actual) x turnover intentions x union loyalty x vdl quality x willingness to work for the union  x  work engagement x work withdrawal x  subtotal (follower) 42 9 13 27 2  table 7 (continued)  leader/follower variable dimensions  affect behavior cognition other  leader affect expression x delegation x diversity behavior x dominance x ethical leadership x idea generation x influence in decision making  x  leader effectiveness x x liking for leader x lmx x x managerial support x x x nurturance x petty tyranny x quality of communication  x  respect for leader x talk time x trust x x work facilitation x  subtotal (leader) 18 6 12 5 0 total 60 15 25 32 2  note. all are individual-level (and not dyad-level) variables.  j. kim, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101306  13    taking a dyadic perspective include:  1. what underlies the formulation of dyadic relationships and how do the components interact to build the relationships? (e.g., other than lmx, what are the characteristics of low/high performing dyads and do they operate at the dyad level?; in addition to support for self- worth and satisfying performance, what can be exchanged within a dyad to increase the interdependency of a leader and a follower within a dyad?)  2. what properties emerge after interactions/exchange between a leader and a follower and how long do these elements take to emerge within the dyad?  3. for leader-follower congruence studies, what affect- and behavior- based individual differences can be matched in a dyad to predict individual and dyadic outcomes?  4. what dyad characteristics can impact better/worse leader-follower congruence (e.g., relationship perceptions)?  5. what dyad-level consequences can be predicted from leader-fol- lower dyadic relationships? (e.g., can individual-level outcomes studied in leader-follower congruence studies also be examined at the dyad-level? what are the dyad-level outcomes of low/high- quality dyadic relationships?)  finally, suggestions for methodology include:  1. when interested in dyadic phenomenon, collect data on the variable of interest from both a leader\\'s and a follower\\'s perspective and combine, when appropriate, responses from the two perspectives to generate a dyad-level variable. when aggregation of dyad scores of the focal variable is necessary, test the level of the variable via waba or some other appropriate technique after combining the responses.  2. specify the type of dyads (i.e., independent vs. dependent dyads) collected in the study by providing the number of both leaders and followers in the sample.  3. when dyads are dependent (i.e., nested within groups having one leader and multiple followers), consider the dependency in the analysis by either testing the potential group-level effects through waba or calculating iccs, for example, before conducting dyad- level analyses, or conduct multilevel (random coefficient) modeling to consider both dyad-level effects and group-level effects (see gooty & yammarino, 2011; yammarino & gooty, 2019).  in a more general way, we believe the results of this review point toward several broad potential future directions for research related to leader-follower dyads. first, there is a great need to unpack and explore the temporal dynamics of leader-follower relationships. the process- oriented theories related to leader-follower dyads (e.g., individualized leadership and relational leadership theory) have received very little empirical attention from a pure dyad perspective. this is unfortunate as dyadic phenomena do not always emerge from leader-follower inter- actions (see gooty & yammarino, 2011; yammarino & gooty, 2017), and it would be helpful to know how the various temporal dynamics suggested by existing theories inform our understanding of these rea- lities. moreover, given the potential value of high quality leader-fol- lower dyadic relationships to positively impact an array of important outcomes (e.g., dansereau et al., 1984; gooty & yammarino, 2016; markham et al., 2010), it would be insightful to enhance understanding of factors that could accelerate the rate of development for these re- lationships.  there is no doubt that the longitudinal studies needed to explore such leader-follower relationships are challenging: they require in- tensive repeated data collection and additional modeling complexities (e.g., bliese & lang, 2016; ployhart & vandenberg, 2010). however, recent advances in big data and the increasing availability of “digital traces” (kozlowski, chao, chang, & fernandez, 2015) may ease the  collection of repeated data for both leaders and followers. additionally, there are likely to be ways to combine existing dyadic data analysis methodologies with multilevel modeling and other growth modeling techniques (e.g., bliese & ployhart, 2002) to address modeling com- plexities. lastly, there are potentially interesting ways in which com- putational models/agent-based simulations can be coupled with tar- geted empirical studies (cf. grand, braun, kuljanin, kozlowski, & chao, 2016) to shed light on and investigate important temporal aspects in- volved with the development and maintenance of leader-follower dyadic phenomena.  second, there is room to further investigate the conceptual com- plexities involved with dependent leader-follower dyads. while this review demonstrates that these types of dyads are common, much of existing research has focused on the methodological implications of these dyads. the unique theoretical implications associated with these types of dyads, such as the potential for there to be contagion and other diffusion effects among leader-follower dyads in a given group and the possibility for characteristics associated with follower-follower dyads to impact leader-follower dyads, have yet to be incorporated into existing theories regarding leader-follower dyads. such considerations are likely to be particularly important as scholarship in this area more fully in- vestigates the temporal aspects involved with the development and maintenance of leader-follower dyadic phenomena.  third, we see potential for the use of network-related approaches to examine leader-follower dyadic phenomena. the dyad is a fundamental unit of analysis in network-based approaches, and it offers the added benefit of providing the ability to visualize and explore the broader pattern and configuration of dyads in a given unit (borgatti & foster, 2003; borgatti, mehra, brass, & labianca, 2009; wasserman & faust, 1994). despite these applicable and potentially insightful aspects of network-based methods, this review did not identify any “pure” dyad leadership studies that used network techniques. there is thus an op- portunity to leverage network approaches, particularly exponential random graph models (kim, howard, pahnke, & boeker, 2016; lusher, koskinen, & robins, 2013) and associated multilevel extensions (wang, robins, pattison, & lazega, 2013; zappa & lomi, 2015), in future leader-follower dyads studies.  fourth, there are opportunities to explore the bottom-up impact of dyad-level phenomena and outcomes on phenomena at a higher-level of analysis beyond the dyad. while this review found that the examination of dyad-level outcomes was relatively rare (especially when compared to the emphasis on outcomes at the individual level), consideration of the impact at the group/team or higher levels of analysis was practi- cally nonexistent. this is surprising as dyads are frequently referred to as the fundamental building blocks of groups/teams and are likely to play an important role in the emergence of a variety of group/team phenomena (e.g., cohesion, trusting environment, climate) (e.g., liden et al., 2016). moreover, prior research suggests that leader-follower dyads are likely to be a particularly salient set of dyads in a given group/team (bass, 2008; gooty & yammarino, 2011; yammarino & gooty, 2017). we therefore see possibilities for future theoretical and empirical research on leader-follower dyads to enhance understanding of how the dynamics and outcomes associated with these dyads can impact phenomena and outcomes at the group/team levels of analysis.  finally, given our review of pure leader-follower dyad relationships, we believe it is premature to offer specific practical implications when we do not know much about leader-follower dyads yet. if leader-fol- lower dyads research expands by addressing more diverse research questions and including more constructs, and the findings are re- plicated, then we would be able to provide practical implications such as how to build high-performing dyadic relationships, how to manage low-quality dyadic relationships, and what leaders and followers can expect from their good/poor dyadic relationships. until that point in the development of this line of research (i.e., more data, more re- plications, better understanding of foundational issues), we believe that it is prudent scientifically to avoid asserting practical implications when  j. kim, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101306  14    they are not warranted or may be inaccurate.  conclusion  the current review presents a summary of leader-follower dyads research and identifies areas that have been understudied and require additional theoretical and empirical attention. we also have provided suggestions regarding several new promising directions for future re- search on leader-follower dyads to explore. our overall hope is that these findings stimulate greater specificity in future leader-follower dyads research, increase the appropriate investigation of purely dyadic phenomena between leaders and followers, and lay the groundwork for a new wave of research related to leader-follower dyads.  references1  *adebayo, d. o., & udegbe, i. b.

however, the re- viewers and i work in a constructive and developmental manner to enhance the publication potential of each manuscript. typically, full manuscripts undergo at least two and typically more revisions before a final decision is made with regard to publication suitability in the yearly review. these articles take the form of narrative reviews, in- tegrations, meta-analyses, and other formats related to the focal topic of leadership, broadly defined.  in terms of article scope, we seek to publish reviews on substantive areas of leadership theory and research, or to address relevant metho- dological issues. in particular, we seek to publish articles that have the potential to launch a new line of research, redirect existing research streams, propose concrete research agendas, or shut down areas of scholarship that are no longer relevant or have ceased making mean- ingful contributions to the field. what we do not typically publish in the yearly review are theory-development pieces into new areas of lea- dership science. those types of papers should be submitted for review to the regular issue or a relevant special issue. regardless of focus or approach, we strive for yearly review articles to be “pushing the en- velope” in the respective area of leadership being reviewed. authors are encouraged to take a stand, be provocative, and even stir some con- troversy, if needed.  the current issue comprises 13 articles that review relevant  leadership literature and forge directions for future researchers to build on. the lead article focuses on an important methodological topic by providing an introduction, review, and guidelines for conducting nat- ural experiments in the leadership field (jost sieweke and simone santoni). other articles in the issue include a review and critique of the “healthy leadership” literature (cort rudolph and colleagues) and ex- amining the contemporary topic of leading teams in the digital age (lindsay larson and leslie dechurch), reviewing much of what is known on leadership and technology. additional reviews include the topics of functional leadership in multi- and inter-team contexts (dorothy carter and colleagues); leader-follower transgressions and relationship repair and outcomes (olga epitropaki and colleagues); si- tuation-trait approaches and situation-encoding schema in leader de- cision-making (ryan gottfredson and christopher reina); leadership in and of socio-political vanguards, also known as political fringe groups (richard marcy); examining what we know about the daily causes and consequences of leadership behaviors on what is called everyday lea- dership (thomas kelemen and colleagues); follower transformation as the foundation of transformational leadership theory (nathapon siangchokyoo and colleagues); evolution-based dual strategies for un- derstanding leadership in modern organizations (kaylene mcclanahan); leader-follower dyads (kim jayoung and colleagues); and leadership succession in business and political organizations (bassam farah and colleagues). the final article provides a review of the literature pub- lished during the third decade of the leadership quarterly (kevin lowe and colleagues) following an informal tradition that takes decennial perspectives on the accumulation of leadership science in the journal. it is a diverse and wide-ranging collection of article topics that will cer- tainly stimulate – and possibly even provoke – your thinking about leadership research, theory, and methods. in keeping with the spirit of the journal and its international focus, the authorship teams in this volume represent multiple countries and continents.  in closing, on behalf of the authors and myself, many thanks to the reviewers for their constructive and developmental comments that ul- timately improved every article in this issue. looking ahead, i en- courage future authors to consider submitting their proposals for future yearly review issues that consider timely and provocative leadership issues. in the meantime, i hope you enjoy reading the 2020 yearly review.  david v. day claremont mckenna college, claremont, ca 91711, usa  e-mail address: david.day@cmc.edu.  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2020.101402  the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101402  available online 24 february 2020 1048-9843/ © 2020 published by elsevier inc.  t  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10489843 https://www.elsevier.com/locate/leaqua https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2020.101402 mailto:david.day@cmc.edu https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2020.101402 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2020.101402 http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2020.101402&domain=pdf   contents lists available at sciencedirect  the leadership quarterly  journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/leaqua  call for proposals  the leadership quarterly yearly review (lqyr) for 2022 kevin b lowe (incoming yearly review editor) university of sydney business school  the leadership quarterly seeks proposals for the 2022 lqyr; his- torically, these articles are high-impact and important contributions to the success of the journal. eligible topics are broadly defined to include theory, research, and practice in the field of leadership. published manuscripts could include systematic literature reviews, theoretical integrations, bibliometric studies, new methodological developments, meta-analyses, or some combination of these. the review could be set in any scientific discipline that studies leadership scientifically, from tra- ditional organizational behavior, management or industrial-organiza- tional psychology points of views to other perspectives including but not limited to evolutionary biology, neuroscience, anthropology, eco- nomics, or sociology. of particular interest are contributions that adopt provocative—but also theoretically or empirically grounded—view- points that go beyond reviewing the relevant literature to proposing where the future of leadership studies should, and should not, continue. for example, are there theories, measures, or practices that no longer contribute meaningfully to the field of leadership broadly construed? are some definitions of constructs badly defined and operationalized? should a particular approach to studying leadership be abandoned? well-reasoned and soundly-argued papers with persuasive evidence, serving to stimulate debate and potentially change the field will be given special consideration in the review process. as always, we en- courage integrative and synthetic reviews of research streams that are not only exemplary, but where new developments and insights will trigger advances in leadership research.  potential authors are required to submit a 10-page maximum (plus references, tables, figures, and other end matter not included in the 10- page maximum), double-spaced proposal outlining the proposal topic  and approach. authors sending a full manuscript instead of proposal will not be considered for the lqyr. the proposal must elaborate on why coverage of a chosen topic(s) is necessary, and concisely sum- marize the potential contribution of the work in terms of how the manuscript will serve leadership theory, research, and/or practice per se or to reshape them. proposal submissions (and full papers) are sub- ject to competitive peer-review with an accept/reject option (note, proposals that are deemed by the editorial team to be exceptional in terms of excellence will be given an immediate accept/revise decision).  for articles to be published in the first issue of 2022, the please note the following timetable:  submission stage deadline  1. proposals submitted through evise choosing lqyr 2020 as the item type  16 october 2020*  2. decisions sent to authors for paper commissioning 15 january 2021 3. invited paper first full drafts submission deadline 15 april 2021 4. decisions sent to authors for manuscript revision 31 may 2021 5. deadline for receipt of final manuscripts from invited  authors 1 september 2021  *authors may submit their proposals starting 16 september 2020;

and 2) successfully moved from being a new journal to one that was more established for pro- moting leadership research. the authors suggested that lq\\'s second decade would offer an important opportunity to solidify the journal\\'s emergent position as a place to publish and obtain the best in leadership research.  in lq\\'s second decade gardner et al. (2010) catalogued 353 pub- lished articles as compared to 188 in the first decade — an increase of 88%. this significant growth in the number of published articles was achieved by increasing the number of publications per issue and in- creasing this “quarterly” journal to six issues each year. the number of pages grew from 4501 in the first decade to 7870 in the second dec- ade—an increase of 75%. the increased number of articles and pages did not come at the expense of quality, as the journal\\'s impact factor continued to climb in the second decade, as indicated by the upward trend from 2006 (if = 1.72), to 2007 (if = 1.77), and 2008 (if = 2.21). once again, special issues played an important role in attracting high quality leadership research to lq with 17 special issues published, a near doubling of the nine in the prior decade. fifty-five percent of the articles were empirical (it was also 55% in the first decade), and 42% were theoretical or review pieces (as compared to 46% in the first decade), a remarkably consistent pattern over multiple time periods and editors. neo-charismatic approaches were again the most frequently employed theoretical category with 84 articles pub- lished in the second decade as compared to 68 neo-charismatic articles in the first. however, this absolute increase masks the more interesting relative decrease in the influence of the neo-charismatic paradigm which declined to 13% of all articles versus 34% in the first decade. gardner et al. (2010) observed an even more dramatic change in the proportion of theories categorized as new directions. the new direc- tions category exploded from 14% of all articles in the first decade to 44% of all articles in the second. theoretical perspectives identified as new directions included: contextual influences on leadership; devel- opment and identification of leaders and leadership; ethical, servant, spiritual, and authentic leadership; leading for creativity and innova- tion; strategic leadership by top executives; leadership in teams and decision groups; political and public leadership; complexity theory of leadership; leadership effects of task, technology, distance, and vir- tuality; ideological and pragmatic leadership; destructive leadership; and leading change in organizations.  the resurgence of interest in leadership research, spurred in part by the neo-charismatic paradigms, prompted gardner et al. (2010) to abandon the leadership taxonomy used in the prior decade\\'s review. in an effort to more carefully describe a vibrant field that was experien- cing many innovations in theoretical development as well as the methods employed to test those theories, they developed a more con- temporary leadership taxonomy, which remains influential in the de- velopment of more recent taxonomies of leadership theory (cf. dinh et al., 2014; meuser et al., 2016).  the expansion of the journal over its second decade in terms of volume and prominence supports the notion that the journal was de- livering on the stated purpose of advancing the understanding of lea- dership as a phenomenon, how to study it, as well as its practical im- plications for organizations. in summarizing the progress of lq over its second decade, gardner et al. (2010) concluded that: 1) the field of leadership was more diverse and robust than at any time in recent decades; 2) there was clear evidence that lq had played an important role in advancing the field theoretically and methodologically; and 3) that lq had solidified its position as the leading outlet focused on publishing rigorous leadership research.  we include this brief overview of lq\\'s journey over the first two decades because it provides the context for grounding our current re- view. in this review we seek, as our focal purpose, to describe the content of the journal over the period 2010–2019. while our primary focus is on the content in the most recent decade, we also seek to compare, on several dimensions, the content of the journal\\'s third  decade with that of prior decades. we make this historical comparison because a secondary purpose of our manuscript is to continue telling the story of the evolution of the leadership quarterly, a story where the first two chapters have been written in ten-year increments (gardner et al., 2010; lowe & gardner, 2000). in doing so, we seek to provide updated answers to the broad research questions we have asked in prior reviews such as: what is published in lq and by whom?; who has provided editorial leadership for the journal and how has the compo- sition (disciplinary and structurally) changed during the decade? what are the topical characteristics (methods and design) and content (the- ories and constructs) of the research that appears in lq?; is lq the primary outlet for quality leadership research? to what extent has lq met its mission? what is the trajectory of the journal and what might that vantage point suggest about the next decade of research that will be published in lq? in addition, we ask new questions, including: where does leadership data come from? what proportion of articles employ multiple methods/studies?  in preparing this review, we are mindful that the leadership field has been fortunate to have multiple excellent comprehensive reviews of the leadership literature in recent years. dinh et al. (2014) utilized a process-oriented framework to review 752 leadership articles published in ten leading journals over a thirteen-year period (2000–2012). in doing so, their focus was on developing a better taxonomy of leadership theory that considered both forms of emergence and levels of analysis. meuser et al. (2016) reviewed 864 leadership articles published in ten top journals over a fourteen-year period (2000–2013). using graphic network analysis, they drew conclusions about the state of theoretical integration in leadership research and identified theoretical neighbor- hoods where focal and supporting leadership theories tended to con- gregate. zhu, song, zhu, and johnson (2019) conducted a bibliometric analysis of co-citation and co-occurrence in 6528 leadership articles over a 28-year period (1990 to 2017) in an effort to describe the de- velopmental trajectory of leadership research over time in terms of significant authors and journals. zhao and li (2019) likewise conducted a bibliographic analysis of leadership theories over the same 28-year time span, but rather than manually coding documents to create a single map of 18 leadership theories, they “used software tools to code and organize 2,115 leadership articles authored by 3,190 authors and published in 10 academic journals.” (p. 396) next, they used the vosviewer, version 1.6.6 (van eck & waltman, 2017, october 23) to visually represent the inductively-derived taxonomies of 56 popular leadership research topics, as well as the collaboration networks of 160 highly productive leadership scholars. lord, day, zaccaro, avolio, and eagly (2017) reviewed leadership research published in the journal of applied psychology over a 99-year period (1917 to 2015). rather than comprehensively including all articles published over that period as was done in the other reviews just described, the approach of lord et al. was “selective, emphasizing those publications that represented or sparked unique turns and conceptual developments in the literature….a subjective task that drew on our combined experience in the leadership field” (p. 434).  while these reviews are useful and influential, the current review is substantively different in terms of scope, scale, and focus. the scope of this manuscript, in terms of variables of interest, is distinct from these other reviews which focused squarely on developing a theoretical tax- onomy (dinh et al., 2014), providing a network of co-citations (zhu et al., 2019), mapping the field of leadership using artificial intelligence (zhao & li, 2019), examining the level of theoretical integration (meuser et al., 2016), or looking for seminal inflection points in the long range trajectory of a journal (lord et al., 2017). in coding for leadership theory, our work resembles that of dinh et al. (2014), meuser et al. (2016), and zhu et al. (2019), but we also code for a range of variables including study design, sample characteristics, methods employed (e.g. cfa, rwg, measure adaption), and author attributes, to name just a few, that were not considered in those reviews. our article is similar to lord et al. (2017) in that we focus on a single journal,  w.l. gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  2    highlight some of the most-cited work, and describe the contents of the journal using theoretical themes, but our approach is markedly dif- ferent as we comprehensively code each article (albeit in a much shorter time frame) and weight each article in a dispassionate manner in our content analysis.  we are able to achieve increased scope, as compared to other re- views through more focus (a single journal) and by reduced scale (coding a decade of articles rather than 13, 14, 28 or 99 years). we also differentiate our review by noting that dinh et al. (2014) and meuser et al. (2016) have 2012 and 2013 respectively as their end-of-analysis years. so, our sample periods have relatively little overlap. collectively, our review is substantially differentiated from other recent reviews of the literature not only in scope and focus, but also by the time period reviewed. finally, because our review of lq\\'s third decade follows a similar approach to that of the reviews for its first and second decades, we can report on trends in this journal over a third point in time.  having situated the current review of lq\\'s most recent decade in the context of prior decade reviews and recent reviews of the leadership literature, we turn to a description of the approach and content of this review. multiple methods were used to prepare this review including quantitative techniques and qualitative analyses. our content analysis examines the type of article (theory, empirical, and methods), con- tributors (gender, discipline, institutional affiliation, and location), theoretical foundations, research strategies, sample type, data collec- tion measures and methods, and analytical procedures across the decade. embedded in this discussion are an assessment of the top in- stitutional contributors; the number, focus, and role of special issues; and a citation analysis of the decade\\'s most cited articles. following from the content analysis, we provide summary-level observations about the content and trajectory of research published in lq over the most recent decade, comparing that to the previous two decades of lq. we conclude with directions for future research by revisiting the re- commendations offered in the prior lq decade reviews and assess the extent to which those recommendations have been fulfilled by the field. we also share observations from the three scholars who served as edi- tors during lq\\'s third decade on the trends in the topics and methods used to extend our knowledge of leadership theory and practice.  methods  we coded many of the variables found in the lowe and gardner (2000), gardner et al. (2010), and dinh et al. (2014) reviews, while adding some new features. we coded article type, expanding on the typology of dinh et al. (2014): qualitative, quantitative, theory, method, special issue, and review issue. we utilized a slightly modified version of the gardner et al. typology of methods as expanded by dinh et al.: computer simulation, content analysis, diary study/experience sampling method (esm), lab experiment, field study (primary data), field survey (secondary data), field experiment, experimental simula- tion, quasi-experiment, judgment task, meta-analysis (quantitative re- view), and review (non-meta-analysis), to which we added convenience sampling, interviews, observation, and archival data. rather than use the gardner et al. case study/qualitative study category, we employed the expanded typology of cresswell and poth (2018, p. 82) for quali- tative designs: 1) narrative, 2) phenomenological, 3) grounded theory, 4) ethnographic, and 5) case study. we followed the quantitative analytical method typology employed by scandura and williams (2000), gardner et al. (2010), and dinh et al. (2014). specifically, we coded for whether the article used: 1) simple statistics only (e.g., correlation); 2) analysis of variance (anova/manova) or analysis of covariance (ancova/ mancova); 3) computer simulations (e.g., bootstrapping studies); 4) linear regression; 5) linear techniques for categorical dependent vari- ables; 6) structural equation modeling (sem)/path analysis; 7) mul- tiple-levels-of analysis techniques (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling [hlm], multi-level sem [msem]); 8) meta-analytic techniques (e.g., hunter & schmidt, 2004); 9) non-parametric techniques; and 10) time  series/event history techniques (e.g., latent growth or change mod- eling). after an initial round of coding, we expanded this typology to include: 11) two-stage least squares (2sls; (antonakis, bendahan, jacquart, & lalive, 2010)); 12) (social) network analyses (e.g., com- puting network centrality and/or using ucinet); 13) curvilinear ana- lyses (e.g., edwards & cable, 2009); and 14) dominance/relative weight analysis.  new to this decade review, we elected to explore construct validation over the last decade. for this reason, we moved and separated factor analysis into two categories: 1) confirmatory factor analysis (cfa); and 2) exploratory factor analysis (efa). to this, we added: 3) internal consistency reliability estimates (e.g., cronbach\\'s alpha); 4) interrater reliability (irr); 5) rwg (james, demaree, & wolfe, 1984); 6) icc(1) (bliese, halverson, & schriesheim, 2002); 7) icc(2) (bliese et al., 2002); 8) within and between analysis (waba; yammarino, 1998); 9) test/ retest reliability; 10) split-half reliability; 11) cohen\\'s kappa, 12) con- sensus coding. we also coded: 1) convergent, 2) discriminant, 3) face, and 4) predictive validities, but only if the authors discussed these explicitly. we recorded if the authors reported reliability information for: 1) all relevant variables, 2) only some relevant variables, or if reliability was 3) not applicable for some or 4) not applicable for all variables. continuing the trend of interest in measures, we also recorded if the authors reported employing: 1) existing measures, 2) modified existing measures, 3) a new measure created for the study, 4) difference scores, or 5) unobtrusive measures.  another new feature of our review that differentiates it from others involves coding where, when, and from whom authors acquired their data. we develop the following data source typology: 1) self/focal (e.g., self-rated personality or performance); 2) peer of focal (e.g., questions about a co-worker who is not a supervisor or subordinate); 3) follower of focal (e.g., leader-rated follower performance); 4) leader of focal (e.g., employee reporting about a supervisor); 5) family of focal (e.g., spouse of an employee, as one might find in work-family conflict re- search); 6) customer of focal (e.g., emotional contagion spreading from leader to employee to customer); 7) company archival records (e.g., annual report or turnover data); 8) third-party archival records (e.g., a public database or newspaper); 9) (expert) rater provided (e.g., parti- cipants responding after watching a video, experts rating team inter- actions); and when the referent in question is the 10) team or 11) or- ganization. we also coded from which country the sample was drawn. we coded when these data were collected using the following typology: 1) cross-sectional (all data collected at one time point); 2) cross sectional with a time lag (e.g., follower rating leader at time 1, leader rating follower at time 2 a few weeks later in time), or 3); longitudinal (re- peated measures over time and hypothesized/expected change). our sample type typology is: 1) private/company (e.g., fortune 500 or en- trepreneurial entity); 2) public (e.g., government, municipal, or edu- cation); 3), military; 4) health care; 5) non-governmental organization (ngo); 6) purpose/theoretical sampling (e.g., where a specific popu- lation is targeted because the phenomenon of interest is present or re- levant in that population); 7) snowball sampling; 8) mturk; 9) qualtrics panel; 10) other online third party sampling tool; 11) undergraduate non-working students, 12) undergraduate working students; 13) grad- uate/mba non-working students; or 14) graduate/mba working stu- dents, or 15) sample not reported. in student samples, we recorded the percent of working students when that information was available; student samples where work was not mentioned were coded as non- working.  for leadership theory, we employed the taxonomy provided in meuser et al. (2016), which is available on the journal of management\\'s website as supplemental material (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/ suppl/10.1177/0149206316647099). this built on the taxonomies in lowe and gardner (2000), which gardner et al. (2010), and dinh et al. (2014) expanded and refined. we coded the primary leadership theory, which we call the focal theory, present in the article. like meuser et al., we found that some articles employed an integrated view such that no  w.l. gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  3  https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0149206316647099 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0149206316647099   single theory was focal, and these were coded as such. we also recorded author affiliations and locations as given in the  article, as well as author gender and discipline in order to explore the composition of authorship teams. we acknowledge that gender was coded in a binary fashion (male/female) for this research. finally, to ascertain the extent to which the composition of lq\\'s editorial team leadership reflects the type of diversity of disciplines and international backgrounds that the founding editors sought to achieve (lowe & gardner, 2000), we collected information on the disciplines, institu- tions, and roles of the scholars who served as an associate editor (ae) for lq during its third decade (see table 1).  editorial leadership of lq in its third decade  three scholars served as the editor-in-chief of lq during its third decade: michael (mike) mumford, leanne atwater, and john antonakis. mike mumford took over from jerry hunt in 2005 and served as editor during a pivotal period of lq\\'s development, as he oversaw a sizable increase in submissions (from roughly 80 per year to 250), increases in the number of articles published, special issues on a range of diverse topics (e.g. destructive leadership, team leadership, crisis leadership, and spiritual/authentic leadership), and substantial increases in the impact factor (from 1.75 in 2005 to 2.90 in 2010). the  journal also became more international and embraced a growing di- versity of theoretical perspectives and methods (mumford, 2005; mumford, 2011). all of the aes were united states citizens by birth, and reflected the disciplines of management, psychology, and philo- sophy by training. a complete summary of the disciplines, institutions, roles, and years of appointment for all scholars who served as aes during lq\\'s third decade is provided in table 1.  leanne atwater assumed the role of editor-in-chief in 2011 and served in that role until 2016 (atwater, 2011; atwater, 2016). during her tenure she introduced several innovations, including automated submission and review process, changes to roles and responsibilities of the aes (see table 1), and a further increase in the size and interna- tional composition of the editorial review board. in addition, the number of submissions continued to grow rapidly, increasing from 361 in 2012 to 688 in 2015 (70% of which came from outside the u.s.), while acceptance rates declined from 16% in 2012 to 8% in 2015. during atwater\\'s tenure, lq continued to publish high-quality special issues on relevant topics such as cognition, emotion, gender, network approaches, biology, asian models, and longitudinal studies (see table 2; discussed further in the special issues section). finally, during her tenure five lq articles were “retracted to protect the integrity of the scientific record” (atwater, mumford, schriesheim, & yammarino, 2014, p. 1174). the explanation of the reasons for and the process used  table 1 associate editors of the leadership quarterly (2010–2019).  name discipline/sub-discipline institution role years of service  francis j. yammarino management/leadership state university of new york at binghamton ae/yearly review editor 2010 peter dorfman management/leadership new mexico state university ae/theoretical and practitioner  letters 2010  cynthia mccauley io psychology/leadership center for creative leadership ae/theoretical and practitioner letters  2010  barbara crosby leadership university of minnesota ae/social sciences studies 2010 ron riggio psychology/leadership claremont mckenna college ae/social sciences studies 2010–2013 joanne ciulla philosophy/leadership ethics university of richmond ae/philosophy, ethics and the  humanities 2010  david v. day io psychology/leadership university of western australia;

(2014). mirroring procedures put in place across much of the social sciences, the ultimate consequence of the retractions has been a re- commitment to ensuring the rigor and accuracy of research published in lq through a number of refinements to journal review processes (antonakis, 2017, a), as described below.  john antonakis has served as the editor-in-chief from 2017 to the present. he is the first lq editor to hail from a continent other than north america. indeed, his background is truly unique as he is “the first european editor in chief, a swiss who is u.s. trained, having a south african accent and a greek surname (go figure!)” (antonakis, 2017, a). additionally, he again expanded the number of aes to include “five senior associate editors and nine associate editors, and a junior as- sociate editor3 that assists with article screening” and the size of the editorial board (adding more than 30 members), while further in- creasing the disciplinary and cultural diversity represented among its members (antonakis, 2017, a). disciplines that are represented within the editorial leadership for the first time through the appointment of aes with significant expertise in these fields include behavioral eco- nomics, political science, evolutionary and biological psychology, social psychology, research methods, and strategy and organization theory (see table 1). in addition, greater international representation is ap- parent among the aes, with scholars from europe and australia, in addition to north america.  antonakis also instituted several changes to lq\\'s policies and pro- cesses. he expanded the types of articles that lq publishes to in- clude—in addition to full length articles, lq yearly review of leadership articles, and special issue articles—short communications, commen- taries of published articles, and research proposals (registered reports and results-masked articles). he initially increased the desk reject rate from the 50% level of the prior editorial team to roughly 70%, to “use editorial and reviewer resources wisely and efficiently” (antonakis, 2017, a). at the same time, he charged aes to “spend their time making substantive and constructive comments on manuscripts with potential.”  further, in a section of a position paper (antonakis, 2017, b) titled, “how to make a more useful contribution to the research record,” he challenged submitting authors to strive to make more meaningful contributions through “better theorizing, not ignoring endogeneity, designing realistic experiments, conducting rigorous qualitative re- search, declaring conflicts of interest, being transparent with data, methods and reporting, and being an honest broker” (antonakis, 2017, a). finally, prior to an empirical manuscript being accepted, the methods advisor ae now conducts a check “to ensure that reporting guidelines are followed, that there are no flaws in reporting and ana- lysis, and that limitations are transparently reported” and hence the manuscript is “squeaky clean” (antonakis et al., 2019, p. 5).  early returns on these changes are quite positive, as lq\\'s impact factor has risen from 3.31 in 2016 to 5.63 in 2018. this impact factor places lq 6th among applied psychology journals and 18th among management journals in the most recent rankings (2019 release of journal citation reports; https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/ solutions/journal-citation-reports/). additionally, analyses in a recent “state of the journal” editorial indicate that citations to lq articles within management, applied psychology, and outside disciplines (e.g., economics, political science, industrial engineering, nursing, computer science, social psychology, medicine, public administration, hospitality, leisure, sport and tourism) are increasing rapidly and at rates that compare favorably with those of other and more established manage- ment and applied psychology top tier journals (antonakis et al., 2019). however, what matters most to the leadership of lq is not impact factor per se, which, despite its flaws, is used extensively to judge journal quality; instead, “[w]hat we care most about is to ensure that we report on how leadership works by publishing quality science; science that is robust, creative, and will make a difference” (p. 4).  all three of lq\\'s editors during lq\\'s third decade identified a goal to increase both the size and the diversity of lq\\'s editorial board. an ex- amination of changes in the size and composition of the board over the past decade suggests that some progress in achieving this goal has been made. during the decade, the size of the board increased from 73 to 162 members, while the percentage of female members increased from approximately 30 to 36%. the geographic representation of the board has also expanded. in 2010, scholars from the united states and  table 2 special issue topics.  year volume issue topic editor(s)  forthcoming leadership in the digital era: social media, big data, virtual reality, computational methods, and deep learning  banks, g.c., dionne, s.d., sayama, h., schmid mast, m.  forthcoming evolution and biology of leadership: a new synthesis van vugt, m., von rueden, c. forthcoming economics and leadership garretsen h., stoker j., weber r. forthcoming strategic leadership and strategic management bonardi, j., hitt, m.a., vera, d., withers, m.c. forthcoming 21st century leadership development: bridging science and practice day, d., riggio, r., conger, j., tan, s. forthcoming replication and rigorous retesting of leadership models clapp-smith, r., carsten, m., gooty, j., connelly, s., haslam, a.,  bastardoz, n, spain, s. forthcoming social identity and leadership hogg, m.a., haslam, s.a., rast, d.e., steffens, n.k., gaffney,  a.m. forthcoming leader power: rigorous insights on its causes and consequences sturm, r.e., hertz, h., antonakis, j. 2017 28 4 charisma: new frontiers. a special issue dedicated to the memory of boas  shamir antonakis, j., gardner, w.l.  2017 28 2 dynamic viewpoints on implicit leadership and followership theories foti, r.j., hansborough, t.k, epitropaki, o., coyle, p.t. 2016 27 3 gender and leadership eagly, a.h., heilman, m.e. 2016 27 2 collective and network approaches to leadership cullen-lester, k.l., yammarino, f.j. 2015 26 4 leadership and emotions connelly, s., gooty, j. 2015 26 3 leader cognition mumford, m. 2015 26 1 asian models of leadership arvey, r., dhanaraj, c., javidan, m., zhang, z. 2014 25 1 leadership quarterly 25th anniversary issue yammarino, f.j. 2013 24 3 leader integrity 2012 23 4 leadership and individual differences antonakis, j., day, d.v., schyns, b. 2012 23 2 biology of leadership senior, c., lee, n., butler, m. 2011 22 3 longitudinal studies of leadership development riggio, r.e., mumford, m. 2010 21 4 leadership development evaluation hannum, k.m., craig, s.b. 2010 21 2 public integrative leadership: multiple turns of the kaleidoscope crosby, b.c., bryson, j.m.  3 the title junior associate editor no longer exists. it was replaced with associate editor and methods advisor  w.l. gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  5  https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/journal-citation-reports/ https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/journal-citation-reports/   canada, respectively, composed 76% and 2.7% of the board members versus 59.9% and 2.5% in 2019. conversely, regions experiencing greater representation include europe (10.7%), with the netherlands, united kingdom, norway, switzerland, and finland increasing (27.2%) and scholars from germany, denmark, sweden, france, spain, slovenia and portugal added (though norway and finland are no longer re- presented). australia/new zealand is also more represented (5.3% in 2010 vs. 6.7% in 2019). the middle east, formerly represented only by israel (5.3% in 2010), is now represented by israel and lebanon (2.5% in 2018). unrepresented in 2010, asia, is represented by the countries of singapore and turkey (1.2%) in 2019. through these changes, lq has moved closer to fulfilling the vision of the founding editors to be a global outlet for leadership research.  what has lq published in its third decade and by whom?  number and types of articles  next, we investigated the number and mix of article types by year (table 3). the second decade of lq showed a marked increase in publications over the first decade (from 34 to 62); the number of arti- cles in the third decade remained constant on average (61.5 per year) as compared to the second decade. as gardner et al. (2010) noted, the increase from the first to second decade reflects the move from four to six volumes per year. we found a large range of published articles per year within the decade. 2011 showed the largest number of published articles (79) and 2019 the smallest (41). moreover, 2015 and earlier showed significantly more published articles than 2016 to present (average of 71 vs. 47.25 per year). january 2017 corresponds to a change in editorship, with john antonakis taking over for leanne at- water, who concluded her term in december 2016. as previously noted, john antonakis increased the proportion of desk rejects, producing a reduction in the number of articles published and an increase in rigor.  overall, 69.4% of articles involved quantitative exploration of phenomena, followed by qualitative (10.4%), theory (15.1%), and methods (4.4%) articles. membership in these categories is not mu- tually exclusive. for example, an article could involve a mixed methods approach, employing both qualitative and quantitative exploration techniques. these percentages show a marked change from 2000 to 2010, where theoretical articles accounted for 42.0%. methods articles  continued to decline, suggesting, as gardner et al. (2010) did, that editors may wish to stimulate methods-related submissions when this type of scholarship is called for to advance the exploration of a phe- nomenon. alternatively, it may be that the reason why methods-or- iented articles have declined is that there is now an organization studies journal devoted to publishing methods-oriented articles–organizational research methods. while the number and proportion of articles in re- view issues remains stable (54/15.0% in the prior decade; 89/14.5% currently), the number of special issue articles has remained similar but the proportion has decreased markedly (109/31.0% in the prior decade; 112/18.2% currently). review issues continue to be highly cited, as two of the top three most cited articles of the decade (see table 4) were published in this forum.  special issues  special issues (table 2) represent a significant investment of journal resources in a topic area. in total, there were 22 special issues published or initiated during the decade, which is an increase from nine and 17 in the prior two decades, respectively. the diversity of topics reflect many emerging areas of leadership methods and research, including the biology of leadership (lee, senior, & butler, 2012), asian models of leadership (arvey, dhanaraj, javidan, & zhang, 2015), collective and network approaches to leadership (cullen-lester & yammarino, 2016), leadership and economics (garretsen, stoker, & weber, 2017), and leadership in the digital era (banks, dionne, sayama, & mast, 2019). the variety of these special issue topics demonstrates a con- tinuing commitment to the vision of lq\\'s founders to advance leader- ship knowledge through multi- and interdisciplinary research (lowe & gardner, 2000).  in their review of lq\\'s second decade, gardner et al. (2010) noted that the proliferation of lq special issues was part of a larger trend across top management journals identified by olk and griffith (2004). drawing from archival data and interviews with journal editors, olk and griffith collected data on the quality and impact of special issues for five top tier management journals (academy of management journal, academy of management review, administrative science quarterly, stra- tegic management journal, and organization science). gardner et al. (2010) observed that the proportion of lq special issues published during the journal\\'s second decade (30.3%) was roughly equivalent to  table 3 article type.  year/article count volume qualitative quantitative theory methods special issue review issue total  2010 21 17 44 4 9 15 9 98 68 11.1% 25.0% 64.7% 5.9% 13.2% 22.1% 13.2% 12.1% 2011 22 14 49 24 3 9 8 107 79 12.8% 17.7% 62.0% 30.4% 3.8% 11.4% 10.1% 13.2% 2012 23 3 59 7 7 13 9 98 80 13.0% 3.8% 73.8% 8.8% 8.8% 16.3% 11.3% 12.1% 2013 24 3 45 6 1 6 8 69 61 9.9% 4.9% 73.8% 9.8% 1.6% 9.8% 13.1% 8.5% 2014 25 8 52 4 3 7 7 81 68 11.1% 11.8% 76.5% 5.9% 4.4% 10.3% 10.3% 10.0% 2015 26 8 55 6 0 29 12 110 70 11.4% 11.4% 78.6% 8.6% 0.0% 41.4% 17.1% 13.5% 2016 27 5 45 8 0 21 0 79 55 8.9% 9.1% 81.8% 14.5% 0.0% 38.2% 0.0% 9.7% 2017 28 2 22 13 1 12 13 63 45 7.3% 4.4% 48.9% 28.9% 2.2% 26.7% 28.9% 7.8% 2018 29 3 30 9 0 0 14 56 48 7.8% 6.3% 62.5% 18.8% 0.0% 0.0% 29.2% 6.9% 2019 30 1 26 12 3 0 9 51 41 6.7% 2.4% 63.4% 29.3% 7.3% 0.0% 22.0% 0.0% total 64 427 93 27 112 89 812 total % 10.4% 69.4% 15.1% 4.4% 18.2% 14.5%  note: n = 615 articles; average number of articles per year = 61.5.  w.l. gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  6    table 4 top 50 highly cited papers.  rank cites/year  cites/year rank cites total cites year vol issue authors title type focal theory content  1 76.7 1 690 2010 21 6 antonakis j., bendahan s., jacquart p., lalive r.  on making causal claims: a review and recommendations review none empirical, method, review issue  2 68.6 2 343 2014 25 1 dinh j.e., lord r.g., gardner w.l., meuser j.d., liden r.c., hu j.  leadership theory and research in the new millennium: current theoretical trends and changing perspectives  review none empirical, special issue  6 41.5 3 332 2011 22 6 gardner w.l., cogliser c.c., davis k.m., dickens m.p.  authentic leadership: a review of the literature and research agenda  review authentic leadership theory, review issue  7 36.3 4 290 2011 22 5 rosing k., frese m., bausch a. explaining the heterogeneity of the leadership-innovation relationship: ambidextrous leadership  article entrepreneurial empirical, theory  5 46.5 5 279 2013 24 1 schyns b., schilling j. how bad are the effects of bad leaders?

(2012, p. 88) concluded “that special issues can attract more immediate citations and more overall citations than regular issues as well as having a positive effect on its impact factor in the years immediately following publication.” gardner et al. (2010) came to a similar conclusion regarding articles published in special issues during lq\\'s second decade, as they accounted for 47 of the top 100 most-cited articles, even though they constituted only 30% of the total. however, special issue articles appear to have been less impactful during lq\\'s third decade, as only 7 of the top 50 most-cited articles (14%) appeared in special issues. perhaps, as the topics of lq special issues have grown more focused on particularized and nascent streams of research, their appeal to a wider audience of leadership scholars has declined, at least relative to the prior decade. however, it would be premature to con- clude that lq special issues are not more impactful than articles pub- lished in regular issues. according to scopus data as of december 18, 2019, special issue articles in the third decade have been cited 38.1 times on average compared to 32.7 for regular articles. to further an- swer this question, a more systematic bibliographic analysis along the lines of that conducted by smith et al. (2012) is required, which is beyond the scope of the current review. moreover, as suggested above, we recommend that lq editors continue to publish special issues to help fulfill the journal\\'s ongoing mission to serve as the outlet for cutting edge and multi-disciplinary leadership research.  review issues  with the dawn of the new millennium, lq editor jerry hunt (2000) launched the inaugural lq yearly review of leadership (lqyr). “with this series, jerry displayed his tremendous talent as a visionary and leading edge thinker in bringing us a series of articles from top and emerging scholars not only in leadership, but in other areas jerry saw that could inform leadership” (uhl-bien, 2008, p. 632).1 from the outset, the purpose of the lqyr issue was to provide state-of-the art coverage of a wide range of content and methodologically-oriented pieces, to be complemented by subsequent special issues for some of the featured topics. it was hoped that over time, a wide range of reviews would be provided and serve as a baseline for future work by leadership scholars and others interested in the field of leadership. \"the lqyr reviews were not designed to be encyclopedic, though some are more encyclopedic than others, depending on the topic…they needed to have some kind of integrating framework and generally be understandable by both specialists and generalists…. reviews vary in their breadth but are representative of the topic area selected, and they cover a time period appropriate to tie in with previous work and provide a re- presentative picture of where the topic stands\" (hunt, 2000, p. 432).  a summary of the year, volume, issue, title, editor, and themes of the lqyr issues published in lq\\'s third decade is provided in table 5. note that from its inception in 2000 until 2017, the lqyr issue ap- peared in the last issue of the volume, which was issue 4 until the number of issues expanded to six in 2002. hence, the first six lqyr  t ab le  4 (c on tin ue d)  r an  k ci  te s/  ye ar  c it  es /y  ea r  r an  k ci  te s  to ta  l ci  te s  y ea  r v  ol is  su e  a ut  ho rs  ti tl  e ty  pe fo  ca l  th eo  ry c  on te  nt  46 11  .0 48  88 20  11 22  1 w  an g  h .,  ts ui  a .s  ., x  in k  .r .  c eo  le ad  er sh  ip be  ha vi  or s,  or ga  ni za  ti on  al pe  rf or  m an  ce ,  an d  em pl  oy ee  s\\' at  ti tu  de s  a rt  ic le  st ra  te gi  c em  pi ri  ca l,  qu al  it at  iv e  46 11  .0 48  88 20  11 22  3 h  ar m  s p.  d .,  sp ai  n s.  m .,  h an  na h  s. t.  le ad  er de  ve lo  pm en  t an  d th  e da  rk si  de of  pe rs  on al  it y  a rt  ic le  le ad  er sh  ip de  ve lo  pm en  t em  pi ri  ca l,  sp ec  ia l  is su  e 40  12 .3  50 86  20 12  23 3  pi cc  ol o  r .f  ., b  on o  j. e.  ,h ei  ni tz  k .,  r ow  ol d  j. ,  d ue  hr e.  , ju  dg e  t. a  . th  e re  la ti  ve im  pa ct  of co  m pl  em en  ta ry  le ad  er be  ha vi  or s:  w hi  ch m  at te  r m  os t?  a rt  ic le  n on  e em  pi ri  ca l  1 jerry hunt served as the lqyr editor from 2000 to 2007; mary uhl-bien succeeded him and served as lqyr editor in 2008 and 2009.  w.l. gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  9    issues of lq\\'s third decade appeared in issue 6. however, with the change of editors from leanne atwater to john antonakis in 2017, antonakis decided to publish the lqyr in issue 1, where it has ap- peared every year thereafter. as such, no lqyr issue was published in 2016.  for the first decade (2000–2009) of the lqyr, each issue included reviews on a diverse set of substantive topics, and hence they did not reflect a theme per se. however, the 2010 issue edited by fran yammarino (2010), served as a scholarly tribute to two prominent leadership scholars and former lq editors – bernard m. (bernie) bass and jerry hunt, who had recently passed away. from 2011 to 2015, chet schriesheim served as the lqyr editor; in 2012, he introduced a theme for the first time, as the lqyr focused on methodological ad- vances in leadership research (schriesheim, 2012). the next two lqyr issues likewise had a thematic focus, as both featured articles that ad- vanced traditional leadership theory and research (schriesheim, 2013, 2014). none of the subsequent lqyr issues have had a thematic focus. however, the last three edited by shelley dionne and david day, re- spectively, reflect “multi-disciplinary, multilevel, multisource, multi- skilled and multigenerational perspectives” (dionne, 2017, p. 22), and seek to push the “frontiers of leadership scholarship” (day, 2018, p. 1), through “state-of-the science reviews of leadership theory, methods, and measurement” (day, 2019, p. 10). over the years, this “series has become a cornerstone of lq, and the impact is demonstrated by the fact that, since its inception, lqyr articles have been regular recipients of the best paper award in lq” making it “a noble endeavor” and an ongoing tribute to jerry hunt\\'s legacy (uhl-bien, 2008, p. 632). it is also noteworthy that a disproportionate number of lqyr articles (11/22%) are included among the 50 most highly cited articles discussed in the next section (see table 4), providing further evidence of their impact. review issue articles in the third decade of lq were cited 43.3 times per article on average compared to 32.7 for regular articles. this finding is also consistent with antonakis, bastardoz, liu, and schriesheim\\'s (2014) conclusion that articles published in review issues tend to be highly cited (although they have high variance), as are quantitative, theory, and methods articles.  most cited articles  following gardner et al.\\'s (2010) example, we compiled a list of the most highly cited articles of those published during lq\\'s third decade (see table 4). here, we report the total citations, citations per year, and the rank for each article. the most highly cited article is a lqyr methods review on causal claims (antonakis et al., 2010), suggesting that scholars recognize and appreciate methods articles (antonakis et al., 2014), even though there were not a large number of these published in lq during the last decade. this particular methods article has been highly impactful because it highlights endogeneity issues that negate the ability of authors to make causal inferences about focal re- lationships, but also introduces corrective actions for addressing  endogeneity issues to the leadership field. 2010 ranks first in the number of most highly-cited articles (17), followed by 2011 (14), 2012 (eight), 2013 (five), and 2014 (four). with the exception of 2016 (two), the last half of the decade is absent from this list, most likely because insufficient time has passed for citations of these articles to accumulate. with regards to the leadership theories reflected in highly-cited articles, 19 theories are present. transformational leadership dominates the most-cited list with nine articles focused on its premises. authentic leadership is second with five articles, followed by leadership devel- opment (four), ethical leadership (three), and two articles each for destructive leadership, implicit leadership, leader-member exchange (lmx), servant leadership, followership theory, and participative/ shared leadership/delegation and empowerment.  institutional contributions and authorship teams  we investigated the composition and diversity of authorship teams from the perspective of gender, team size, affiliations, world regions, and how articles, authors, and authorships are distributed across world regions. in order to account for authors who publish multiple papers in lq, we define authorships as the number of papers on which a person is an author.  regarding gender, 58.3% of authors were male versus 41.7% fe- male; 61.4% of authorships were male versus 38.6% female. thus, males are more likely to have published more than once versus females. we noticed that some leadership theories seem to be preferred pub- lication topics based on gender. for example, 73.8% and 67.6% of the authorships on articles which focused on charismatic leadership and participative/shared leadership/delegation and empowerment were male, while 61.6%, 59.6%, and 53.3% of the authorships on articles that focused on leadership development, leadership and diversity, and identity and identification processes, respectively, were female.  author team size varied widely between one and ten authors. three- author teams were most common (31.4% of articles), followed by two- author teams (25.5%), four-author teams (18.4%), five-author teams (9.4%), and single-author papers (8.0%). author teams of six to 10 authors accounted for 7% of papers. the author teams drew from one to seven affiliations, with author teams from two affiliations most common (38.4%), followed by single-affiliation articles (27.6%), arti- cles representing three affiliations (21.6%), and articles with four af- filiations (9.1%). articles with five to seven affiliations represented 2.9% of papers. these affiliations span 41 countries (table 6). authors affiliated with united states universities contributed to 60.3% of arti- cles, followed by the united kingdom (14.3%), australia (9.8%), the netherlands (9.6%), germany (7.5%) and canada (6.7%; see table 6 for others).  we grouped countries together by geographic region in order to parsimoniously investigate the diversity of contributions and con- tributors. articles with authors from a single region dominated lq in the last decade (69.9%), yet a meaningful number (26.7%) came from  table 5 yearly review issues.  year volume issue title theme editor/citation  2010 21 6 a scholarly tribute to bernard m. bass and james g. hunt no yammarino, f. j.

(2010) concluded that progress toward this goal was achieved in lq\\'s second decade, as the proportion of au- thors from non-management/business disciplines increased from 33% to 38%. our findings suggest that this trend was reversed in lq\\'s third decade, as roughly two-thirds (69.3%) of authorships were again af- filiated with management departments, and another 23.6% with psy- chology departments, leaving only 7.2% from other fields (i.e., 30.7% non-management). however, greater diversity of disciplines is apparent for 2019 (table 9), where the proportion of psychology-affiliated au- thorships dropped to 18.6%, and the level of representation from the fields of economics (6.4%), anthropology (2.1%), and other fields (3.6%) increased. thus, we echo lowe and gardner\\'s initial conclusion that only modest success with regard to this element of lq\\'s mission has been achieved over the past three decades. nonetheless, there is some preliminary evidence that the strategic decision of the current editor, john antonakis, to recruit aes with more diverse disciplinary back- grounds is attracting scholars from disciplines that have not historically been represented among contributing authors. it remains to be seen if this trend will be sustained and perhaps accelerated over the next decade.  coder agreement  in an effort to ensure consistency in the coding of articles, the six- member author team developed a coding manual. each article was then coded by one of the authors using the codebook as a point of reference. in a further effort to promote coding consistency, the author team met regularly throughout the coding process to discuss and address any challenges/uncertainties regarding the coding scheme and its applica- tion. following the coding of the 615 articles, interrater reliability was computed by having a different author independently code a subset of 20% of the articles. interrater reliability was computed for the three main coding categories of focal theory, article type, and study methods and analyses. note that the article type and focal theory were coded at the article level, whereas the study methods and analysis were coded at the study level, since some articles reported methods and results for multiple studies. the percentage agreement for the focal theory, a single coding item, was 93%. for article type, the percentage agreement was 97% and the pairwise cohen\\'s kappa was 0.92 with a range of 0.88–0.97. for study methods, the percentage agreement was 98% and cohen\\'s kappa was 0.89 with a range of 0.81–0.96. each of these results is indicative of a very high level of rater agreement and hence reliability (fleiss, 1981), with values of 0.81–1.0 characterized as near perfect agreement (landis & koch, 1977). following the computation of the interrater reliability statistics, all discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached.  leadership theories  a summary of the focal theories reflected in studies published in lq during the last decade, as coded using the aforementioned meuser et al.

coded supporting theories that complemented the focal theory, for the sake of parsimony, we limit our analysis and discussion to the focal theories. nonetheless, it is also important to recognize that many leadership theories that were infrequently identified as focal theories nonetheless appeared as supporting theories (e.g., attribution theories, transactional  leadership) that were used in concert with the focal theory to better explicate the nuances and intricacies of dynamic leadership processes.2  before we examine the focal theories published in lq during its  table 8 contributions

elaborate on the findings from the prior two decades provided in our introduction. lowe and gardner (2000) found that neo-charismatic leadership theories, which included transforma- tional leadership, were by far the most common focal theories (34%) employed in lq articles during the journal\\'s first decade, followed by contingency theories (12%), multiple level approaches (9%), and trait theories (8%). however, a full quarter of the theories were classified as other approaches and encompassed leadership and diversity, cross- cultural leadership, and managerial work. moreover, 14% of the arti- cles were classified as new directions. in lq\\'s second decade, the focal leadership theories that lowe and gardner (2000) categorized as new directions exploded to encompass a full 44.4% of the articles, with emerging theories such as ethical/servant/spiritual/authentic leader- ship (5.4%), the development and identification of leaders and lea- dership (5.5%), and contextual influences on leadership (5.6%) gaining attention. while neo-charismatic (12.6%) approaches remained pop- ular, the proportion of articles focused on these approaches declined, as it did for more traditional leadership theories such as trait theories (3.8%), behavioral theories (4.4%), and contingency theories (1.0%). slightly more attention was devoted to multiple level approaches (12%) in lq\\'s second decade.  an examination of table 10 reveals some interesting trends in terms of the relative prominence of theories represented in lq studies over the past decade. at the outset, it is important to recognize that the focal theory taxonomies used by lowe and gardner (2000) and gardner et al. (2010) included 28 and 29 theories, respectively. in contrast, the meuser et al. (2016) taxonomy we employed includes 49 focal theories; hence, comparisons of the proportions of articles that adopted a given focal theory are smaller, simply because there are more focal theories. as such, our comparisons across decades focus on the relative propor- tions of articles using a focal theory, as opposed to the percentage. to facilitate such comparisons, we have sorted the focal theories from most to least commonly used and grouped them into clusters in the table.  the first cluster reflects the most commonly-used focal theories and includes nine that were invoked in more than 4% of the articles coded. as in lq\\'s first decade, transformational leadership again emerged as the most commonly researched theory, serving as the focal theory in 7.6% of the articles. note that in their 2010 review, gardner and colleagues did not distinguish between transformational and charismatic leadership, as both were coded as neo-charismatic theories. applying the more fine-grained meuser et al. (2016) taxonomy, however, it becomes apparent that  popularity of these theories has followed different trajectories, as charis- matic leadership only served as the focal theory in 3.4% of the articles. thus, despite pointed criticisms (e.g., van knippenberg & sitkin, 2013), transformational leadership theory remains popular. in contrast, despite antonakis, bastardoz, jacquart, and shamir\\'s (2016) efforts to strengthen charismatic leadership theory and a special issue devoted to the topic (antonakis & gardner, 2017), the proportion of articles focused on char- isma has declined. nonetheless, we speculate that the refined definition and recommendations for enhancing the rigor of charismatic leadership research advanced by antonakis et al. (2016) may stimulate renewed in- terest in the topic in the next decade.  interestingly, the coding category of “none” tied with transformational leadership as the most commonly selected category at 7.6%. this indicates that many articles published in lq\\'s third decade lacked a focal theory. reasons why this category may have been applicable include: a) the in- clusion of multiple but no dominant leadership theory (often the case for review articles such as this one); b) a focus on methods rather than theory; and c) a focal theory that reflects a new conceptual perspective that could not be classified using the meuser et al. (2016) taxonomy. the former case is consistent with meuser and colleagues\\' conclusion that many leadership articles draw upon and integrate multiple leadership theories. in the latter case, the “none” category essentially reflects the new directions category employed in the prior two reviews. thus, even with a taxonomy of 49 leadership theories, new theories emerged over the last decade that defied classification. this finding documents the theoretical vigor of the field, while simultaneously raising concerns about unnecessary construct pro- liferation (banks, gooty, ross, williams, & harrington, 2018; leavitt, mitchell, & peterson, 2010).  the next most common focal theory was leadership development at 5.8%. the inclusion of a special issue devoted to leadership develop- ment (riggio & mumford, 2011) early in the decade clearly contributed to the relatively high proportion of articles with the publication of ar- ticles in subsequent years demonstrating continued interest in the topic. we consider this to be a very positive development as insufficient at- tention has been devoted to this critical topic in the past. leader- member exchange (lmx) theory emerged as the third most common focal theory (5.7%), and interest in this topic remained strong throughout the decade. lq\\'s third decade also saw a resurgence in at- tention to trait (dispositional) approaches, as this constituted the fourth most common focal theory (5.0%). perhaps this resurgence is, at least in part, the result of work by judge and colleagues (judge & bono, 2000;  table 9 author discipline.  year management psychology anthropology economics sociology political science engineering medical legal philosophy mathematics physics other  2010 125 43 0 1 0 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 19 64.4% 22.2% 0.0% 0.5% 0.0% 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 9.8%  2011 143 73 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 61.9% 31.6% 0.4% 0.4% 0.4% 0.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 4.8%  2012 181 57 1 2 0 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 6 71.8% 22.6% 0.4% 0.8% 0.0% 0.4% 0.4% 1.2% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.4%  2013 146 34 0 5 0 4 0 1 0 0 0 0 4 75.3% 17.5% 0.0% 2.6% 0.0% 2.1% 0.0% 0.5% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.1%  2014 173 64 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 7 69.8% 25.8% 0.0% 0.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.4% 0.8% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.8%  2015 165 59 3 5 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 1 69.3% 24.8% 1.3% 2.1% 0.0% 0.0% 0.4% 1.7% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.4%  2016 124 27 0 2 1 7 1 1 0 0 0 0 5 73.8% 16.1% 0.0% 1.2% 0.6% 4.2% 0.6% 0.6% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 3.0%  2017 103 38 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 3 69.6% 25.7% 0.7% 1.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.7% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.0%  2018 117 47 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 68.4% 27.5% 0.0% 2.3% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 1.2% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.6%  2019 97 26 3 9 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 3 69.3% 18.6% 2.1% 6.4% 0.7% 0.0% 0.0% 0.7% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.1%  totals 1374 468 9 32 3 14 6 18 0 0 0 0 60 69.3% 23.6% 0.5% 1.6% 0.2% 0.7% 0.3% 0.9% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 3.0%  w.l. gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  13    judge, colbert, & ilies, 2004; judge, piccolo, & kosalka, 2009) which demonstrated that prior reviews were misinterpreted as dismissing the utility of the trait approach (mann, 1959; stogdill, 1948). this dismissal is now regarded as premature as traits were shown to have considerable power in predicting leadership emergence and effectiveness. prominent theories that were previously coded by lowe and gardner (2000) and gardner et al. (2010) as other approaches or new directions that gained increased attention in lq\\'s third decade include leadership and diversity (4.9%), emotions and leadership (4.7%), strategic leadership (4.5%), and destructive leadership (4.1%), which includes abusive su- pervision. it is noteworthy that dinh et al. (2014) reported similar findings with respect to the prominent and emerging theories they identified in their review of the leadership literature published in top management journals between 2000 and 2012.  the next set of focal leadership theories includes 18 that were found in less than 4% but more than 1% of the articles coded. note that ethical (3.4%), authentic (3.1%), and servant (1.3%) leadership first emerged as focal theories in the gardner et al. (2010) review, where they were  grouped together with spiritual leadership to account for 5.4% of the focal theories. as a set, it is clear that these theories garnered increased attention over the past decade. additionally, given that these theories differ in their assumptions and posited processes, the separation of these theories into distinct categories proved to be useful, both for conceptual reasons and to better track their relative influence. the rise of these theories is consistent with trends identified by dinh et al. (2014), which suggests that the field of leadership and lq in particular continues to be open to new and maturing perspectives, along with empirical tests of theories that emerged during the prior two decades. additional focal theories that were labeled as other approaches and new directions in prior reviews that fall into this cluster include lea- dership in teams (1.9%), contextual/complexity/adaptive approaches (1.9%), power/influence/politics (1.8%), public leadership (1.8%), and cross-cultural leadership (1.3%). interest in these topics has remained relatively steady over the past two decades. finally, some focal theories (e.g., followership theory; 1%) gained recognition as distinct theories for the first time, while the influence of some theories that

0% of the studies coded. this cluster includes a mixture of theories from relatively young areas of inquiry (e.g., ideo- logical/pragmatic [0.8%], relational [0.8%], social network [0.6%], entrepreneurial [0.3%], spiritual [0.3%], and e-leadership [0.2%]), as well as others that are more mature (e.g., leadership skills/competence [0.6%], reward and punishment behavior [0.5%], romance of leader- ship [0.3%], transactional [0.2%], leader motive profile [0.2%], pygmalion effect [0.2%], and contingency [0.2%] approaches).  the final cluster of theories identifies nine theories that are included in our taxonomy but were not indicated as the focal theory in any ar- ticle published in lq in the most recent decade. these include a mixture of mature theories (e.g., leadership substitute theory, multiple linkage theory, path-goal theory, attribution theories, situational leadership theory, idiosyncratic leadership theory), and several that are relatively narrow in focus (e.g., aesthetic leadership, self-sacrificing, flexibility leadership theory). while a resurgence of interest in some of the mature approaches is certainly possible, as has been the case for the trait ap- proach, we think it is more likely that the decades-long decline in at- tention to these approaches (dinh et al., 2014; gardner et al., 2010; lowe & gardner, 2000; zhao & li, 2019) will continue, while the trends for the ascending approaches (e.g., authentic, ethical, servant, and strategic leadership; dinh et al., 2014; zhao & li, 2019) will be sus- tained. perhaps some of the more narrowly-focused theories are can- didates for integration with more general leadership theories, such as contextual/complexity/adaptive approaches to leadership.  quantitative techniques and designs  a summary of the types of research designs used in quantitative studies is presented in table 11. as with prior decade reviews, we found that field surveys are still favored when collecting primary data with 46.8% of studies in the present decade employing this technique. one potential concern is the use of convenience samples (e.g., students, online panels, or samples from authors\\' own social media connections), which accounted for the sample in 54.0% of the 598 quantitative studies, the vast majority of which involved surveys. laboratory experiments showed a marked increase in usage, ranking second (26.4%) overall; only 5% of quantitative studies used experimental designs in the prior decade. consistent with prior decade reviews, we find experience sampling, field experiments, quasi-experiments, field surveys with secondary data, and computer simulations to be employed infrequently. clearly, given the strengths of some of these designs, such as quasi-experimental research (grant & wall, 2009), opportunities remain to better capitalize on a wider range of research designs to generate novel and more rigorous findings.  quantitative analytical techniques  a summary of the analytical/statistical techniques employed in quantitative studies is provided in table 12. the most common statis- tical analyses performed in quantitative studies were: 1) linear regres- sion (43.0%); 2) analysis of variance, including both anova, ancova, and manova/mancova (32.6%); 3) structural equation modeling (sem) and path analysis (16.6%); and 4) multi-level analytical techni- ques (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling [hlm], and multi-level sem; 19.2%). given the inherently multi-level nature of leadership phe- nomena (e.g., leaders and members within dyads and groups; leaders, members and groups within organizations), it is somewhat surprising that multi-level analytical techniques were not used more often. nonetheless, they were used more often than was the case in the prior decade (8%), so there is evidence of increasing efforts to evaluate multi- level leadership relationships. another favorable trend involves the increased use of non-parametric techniques (8.4%) over the prior decade (2%), as such methods have notable advantages over traditional null hypothesis testing (kruschke, aguinis, & joo, 2012).ta  bl e 11  r es  ea rc  h de  si gn  s.  y ea  r v  ol c

employing self-report data (e.g., personality measures) accounted for 59.3% of studies, while 40.5% captured data about supervisors from followers and 12.8% capture data from leaders about followers. what our sample data do not reveal is the proportion of studies that collected data from dyads (e.g., both the leader and the follower rate the quality of their relationship; (gooty & yammarino, 2011). however, given the relatively small proportion of data collected by one half of the potential dyad–leaders–we suspect that such cases of matching data where both parties rate the same variable (e.g., lmx quality) continue to be rela- tively rare, as found in prior reviews (gooty, serban, thomas, gavin, & yammarino, 2012). this supports concerns that leadership research is not adequately capturing the dyadic and reciprocal nature of the re- lationship. likewise, researchers may not be adequately addressing the context within which leadership occurs, as team (5.9%) and organiza- tion (10.0%) data constitutes a small fraction of the data published in lq between 2010 and 2019. nearly absent are reports from peers, fa- milies, and customers/outside sources, representing an opportunity for expanding both theory and research designs. to further consider the concern that researchers may not be adequately addressing the context of leadership, we coded for the country from which study samples were drawn (table 15). most data were sampled from the united states (35.0% of studies) followed by europe (21.7%) with the netherlands (6.6%) being the largest contributor, and asia (9.4%), with china (6.0%) being the largest contributor. some data were truly multi-na- tional (7.2%). sample location was not reported in 10.9% of the em- pirical articles.  measure information  we also examined measures employed in lq empirical studies (table 16). an examination of this table reveals that 70.6% studies that collected data using survey measures employed existing measures, while 30.2% used modified measures, and 31.9% created new mea- sures. one point of concern we encountered involves these newly-cre- ated measures, where only 46 of the 207 studies (22.2%) employed standard scale development practices (e.g., devellis, 2017; hinkin, 1998). this suggests a gap between best and actual practices in lea- dership research. we also noted reliability information was missing in some studies (20.0%; table 17). researchers publishing in lq rarely employed unobtrusive (1.1%) and biometric measures (5.1%), con- tinuing a trend found in the earlier lq reviews. thus, there remains an opportunity for novel research designs to explore leadership phe- nomena. we encountered few instances of the use of difference scores, which are generally seen as poor practice (edwards, 2001). regarding the timing of data collection, cross-sectional designs remain a staple of recent research (67.0%). cross-sectional data collection with a time lag between independent and outcome variables ranks second (19.0%); true longitudinal research characterized by repeated measurement to assess change is still relatively rare (7.6%).  qualitative techniques  few studies during lq\\'s third decade employed qualitative techni- ques (52 studies, 8.7% of empirical studies; table 18). qualitative studies were most common in 2010 (25.0%), followed by 2011 (23.1%), and 2014 and 2015 (13.5%), with the other years accounting for less than 10% of the qualitative studies individually and 28.8% together. case studies were the most common form of qualitative en- quiry (44.2% of qualitative studies), followed by grounded theory (23.1%), narrative (21.2%), phenomenological (11.5%), and ethno- graphic (3.8%) approaches. given the complexity of the leadership phenomenon, the dearth of studies that employ these context-rich ap- proaches represents an opportunity for future research. with quanti- tative inquiry alone, there is a risk of ignoring elements that are re- quired for explaining relationships, as qualitative approaches can enhance understanding of the context of leadership relationships as well as the nature of the relationships themselves, thus generating more meaningful explanations (sofaer, 1999).  strengths and limitations  one limitation of our design is the subjective (and error prone) nature of human coding. this limitation is mitigated somewhat by a strength of our design where we entered objective data into a database form, which reduces errors versus entering data into a ms excel file. the very high degree of interrater agreement also suggests that the use of a coding manual and the evolution (expansion) of the coding manual as we learned from the coding process further reduced the chance of error. indeed, a strength over prior decade reviews is the use of an expanded coding scheme, though this introduces the weakness of making direct comparisons between decade reviews more difficult. we believe that as the field evolves, the coding scheme used to describe the field must also expand. when entering author gender, we made our decision based on the first name of the author with further exploration using internet images. it is possible that proquest has errors in this field, our internet search was faulty, or that we intuited wrongly for some authors. we drew our citation information from scopus on december 18, 2019. it is possible that scopus has errors. this also does not account for the full citation record of 2019, which was not possible due to publication deadlines. our author team includes early, mid, and later stage scholars allowing for the strength of a variety of viewpoints. one caveat to the reader: this review is by design and intent restricted to lq\\'s third decade only. as such, trends in the study of leadership that are not represented or proportionally represented in lq publications between 2010 and 2019 are not captured in the present review.  future directions  in their review of lq\\'s

gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  20    gardner (2000) clearly delineated eight content directions for future research. these were derived from their content analysis of lq pub- lications, interviews with the founding editors, and personal insights. in their review of lq\\'s second decade of publications, gardner et al. (2010) briefly revisited these recommended content directions to see how much progress had been made in pursuing them. after doing so, however, they noted the difficulty of preparing a similar set of content- oriented directions for future leadership research, given the “explosion of leadership theories and novelty of approaches to studying leadership that have emerged in the most recent decade” and hence “handicapping a short list of future topics is more speculative than at any time in recent decades” (p. 951). instead, gardner et al. (2010, p. 951) chose to “identify a few study design and methodological aspects that will move the science of the field forward in whatever content domains are re- vealed to be most in favor over the next decade.”  for our review of lq\\'s third decade, it is informative to revisit the content and methodological recommendations offered in past lq re- views as a prelude for our discussion of future research directions. toward that end, we provide a summary of lowe and gardner\\'s (2000) recommended content directions in table 19, along with gardner et al.\\'s (2010) assessment of the extent that they were realized in lq\\'s second decade, and our own assessment of the degree to which they were addressed in lq\\'s third decade. in addition, we provide a summary of gardner et al.\\'s (2010) methodological recommendations in table 20, and include our evaluation of the extent to which these re- commendations have been adopted in lq\\'s third decade. because we found that the content and methodological recommendations offered in the prior reviews remain timely, we base our suggestions for future research on the progress that has been made regarding their suggestions while identifying opportunities for further advancements.  table 19 lq10 review recommendations revisited in lq20 and lq30 reviews.  lq10 future directions identified lq10 future directions revisited in lq20  lq10 future directions revisited in lq30  strategic leadership received considerable attention receiving some attention, but more work is needed. heightened awareness of importance of strategic leadership is apparent from a forthcoming special issue on the topic (bonardi et al., 2018), as well as the inclusion of aes with strategy disciplinary backgrounds.  levels of analysis received the most attention level of awareness and attention to levels of analysis issues continues to increase. leadership development & leadership  systems received little attention attention to leadership development has increased, as apparent from the publication of two  special issues (hannum & craig, 2010; riggio & mumford, 2011), another forthcoming (day et al., 2018), and appearance of the topic within the most cited articles.  leadership context received considerable attention (in second half of decade)  continues to receive moderate levels of attention.  females as leaders received little attention increased attention to gender is apparent from the special issue on gender and diversity (eagly & heilman, 2016). in addition, our coding of articles that focus on “leadership & diversity.” indeed, even though conceptually this theoretical category includes ethnicity, race, etc., we observed while coding that the vast majority of articles coded focused exclusively on gender.  international leadership received little attention still receiving little attention, despite lq\\'s aes, editorial review board, and authors becoming more international and culturally diverse. this is still an opportunity for future research.  technology (impact on leadership) received little attention although our coding scheme did not include a category for technology and leadership per se, a search of technology as a keyword identified few articles. this remains an opportunity for future research.  transformational/charismatic leadership  received the most attention still receiving considerable attention as one of the most common focal leadership theories, and also among the most cited articles.  table 20 lq20 review recommendations revisited.  lq20 future directions identified lq20 future directions revisited in lq30  expand set of measures the number of measures employed has definitely expanded with the introduction of several new leadership scales. but, has the expansion come at the cost of rigor? many articles modified scales and new measures failed to employ standard scale development and validation processes.  studies within studies (e.g., study 1, study 2, study 3)  we have seen an increase in studies within studies, particularly in the most recent full year of lq articles, 2018, with an average of 1.35 studies per article, as opposed to a range from 0.78 to 1.24 in prior years. the extent to which this trend extends into future years merits attention.  interdisciplinary teams though the second decade of lq made progress toward a greater diversity of author disciplines, the third decade saw a reversion with over two thirds of contributing authors being affiliated with management departments and over 90% being affiliated with management or psychology departments. however, perhaps due to the recent increased diversity among the ae team and editorial review board, there is preliminary evidence in the final years of the decade that support an increased representation of authors from other fields. this trend and whether it is sustained should continue to be monitored over the next decade.  multi-level phenomena the adoption of multi-level techniques and examinations continued to increase in lq\\'s third decade. nonetheless, greater recognition of the multi-level nature of leadership phenomena is warranted, highlighting a need for more multi-level studies.  controlled experiments empirical studies in lq\\'s third decade included 20% that employed lab experiments, as compared to only 5% in the previous decade. this suggests that authors are responding to calls for more experimental designs, and particularly realistic experiments ((antonakis, 2017, a, 2017, b)).  alternative methodologies not enough has been done here. over half of the lq studies of the last decade employed one of two designs: field surveys and lab experiments. there is definitely room for a greater variety of research designs (e.g., quasi-experiments).  test competing models while we did not explicitly code the extent to which lq studies tested competing models, our impression from coding is that such tests were infrequent.  cognition studies greater attention is apparent from the special issue on leader cognition and neuroscience (lee et al., 2012), as well as an increase in the occurrence of leader and follower cognitions as a focal leadership theory.  technology (for studying leadership) not enough work has been done to expand the use of technology to study leadership. relatively few studies employed unobtrusive/biometric measures. this represents an area of opportunity as evolving technology provides ever expanding methods for studying leadership.  w.l. gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  21    revisiting lowe and gardner\\'s (2000) content direction recommendations  lowe and gardner\\'s (2000) recommended content directions for future leadership research called for increased attention to the topics of strategic leadership, levels of analysis, leadership development and leadership systems, leadership context, women as leaders, international leadership, technology (impact on leadership), and transformational/ charismatic leadership (see table 19). gardner et al. (2010) concluded that the most attention was devoted to exploring levels-of-analysis is- sues and transformational/charismatic leadership. while our third decade review likewise revealed greater recognition and focus on studying leadership as a multi-level phenomenon as evidenced by the increased use of multi-level analytical techniques, we believe that heightened consideration of this fundamental quality of leadership (e.g., individuals, nested in teams, nested in organizations, nested in industries, nested in nations) is still needed. as for theory and research into transformational and charismatic leadership, the former continues to garner high levels of attention, though not as much as in prior dec- ades on a proportional basis, while the latter has experienced a more precipitous decline in attention. given recent critiques and reorienta- tions of research into transformational (van knippenberg & sitkin, 2013) and charismatic (antonakis et al., 2016) leadership, as well as an lq special issue (antonakis & gardner, 2017) focused on novel and rigorous approaches toward studying the latter topic, we are optimistic that research into these forms of leadership will continue, but in a more productive and theoretically grounded manner that yields more meaningful findings and implications for leadership practice. we also note that alternative forms of inquiry such as qualitative methods might prove useful in enhancing understanding about the context of charis- matic leadership events as well as meaningful explanations about the events themselves.  with regards to strategic leadership, gardner et al. (2010) noted that this topic gained considerable interest during lq\\'s second decade, as apparent from special issues on strategic leadership that appeared both within and outside lq (e.g., academy of management journal, strategic management journal). lq\\'s third decade saw a further increase in attention to strategic leadership, as it was the eighth most common focal theory, and a special issue was devoted to the topic (bonardi, hitt, vera, & withers, 2018). nevertheless, given the importance of strategic leadership to key organizational outcomes including financial perfor- mance, innovation, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability (de kluyver & pearce, 2015; yukl & gardner, 2020), we strongly re- commend that even more theoretical and empirical attention should be devoted to this topic.  gardner et al. (2010) also observed an uptick in attention to con- textual influences on leadership (5.6%) and the related topic of com- plexity perspectives of leadership (1.9%), particularly in the latter half of lq\\'s second decade. however, we observed only modest interest in contextual/complexity/adaptive leadership perspectives, as these served as the focal theory in only 1.9% of the articles published in lq\\'s third decade. we recommend that increased attention be devoted to studying the influence of context on leadership (osborn, uhl-bien, & milosevic, 2014). we consider complexity (marion & uhl-bien, 2001; uhl-bien & marion, 2009) and adaptive leadership (uhl-bien & arena, 2018) theories to be well suited for studying the role of context in leadership processes. as mentioned above, qualitative methodologies may also be beneficial in advancing knowledge about leadership con- text.  as for their remaining content directions for leadership research, gardner et al. (2010, p. 951) stated that, from their “viewpoint there was, relative to the need, a disappointing amount of attention paid to females as leaders, international leadership, leadership systems, and the impact of technology on leadership.” for two of these topical areas–international leadership and the impact of technology on lea- dership—such disappointment continues, as these topics were infre- quently examined in lq\\'s third decade. given the influence of culture  on leadership as documented by the globe study (chokkar, brodbeck, & house, 2007; den hartog, house, hanges, ruiz-quintanilla, & dorfman, 1999; dorfman, javidan, hanges, dastmalchian, & house, 2012; hanges, aiken, park, & su, 2016; house, dorfman, javidan, hanges, & de luque, 2014), greater attention to the manifestation and effectiveness of leadership within an international arena is clearly needed. similarly, as more and more organizations embrace virtual teams (charlier, stewart, greco, & reeves, 2016) and other forms of technology that facilitates geographically-distributed decision-making or management, the importance of e-leadership (avolio, kahai, & dodge, 2000) expands, warranting greater attention to the topic.  the good news is that the other two content topics recommended by gardner et al. (2010) have received an upswing in research attention. specifically, considerable attention has been devoted to leadership development in lq\\'s third decade, as this served as the second most common focal theory (5.8%) for articles published in the most recent decade. indeed, two special issues (hannum & craig, 2010; riggio & mumford, 2011) and another forthcoming (day, riggio, conger, & tan, 2018) indicate current and continuing research interest in this domain. similarly, an increase in attention focused on leadership and diversi- ty–the vast majority of which examines gender effects–is apparent from the rise in the number of articles published from 1.9% in lq\\'s second decade to 4.9% in the third decade. this rise was, in part, aided by a special issue devoted to gender and leadership (eagly & heilman, 2016). while we find these trends encouraging, we recommend that greater attention be devoted to the study of leadership systems, as re- commended by lowe and gardner (2000), as well as other forms of diversity (e.g., ethnicity, race, age, sexual orientation, personality, functional training, cultural background, ability, and religion).  revisiting gardner et al.\\'s (2010) methodological recommendations  a summary of gardner et al.\\'s (2010) methodological re- commendations is provided in table 20. the first involved a move away from the field\\'s reliance on a narrow set of retrospective survey mea- sures [e.g., the multifactor leadership questionnaire (bass & avolio, 1995) or the lmx-7 (scandura & graen, 1984)] as the definition of leadership by expanding the use of real-time measurement (e.g., public opinion polls) and more direct measures of leadership (e.g., content analysis of leader speeches such as those conducted by (bligh, kohles, & meindl, 2004, a, 2004, b)).  our review of lq\\'s third decade revealed that retrospective surveys continue to be the dominant means of measuring leadership phe- nomena, as 46.8% of quantitative studies used such measures, which is an increase to that found in the prior decade (31%). adding to concerns about this methodology are our findings that most of the studies that employed surveys also used convenience samples, raising concerns about the representativeness of the findings. additionally, we found that it was common practice to introduce new survey measures, or modify existing survey measures, without following best practices for scale development and validation (devellis, 2017; hinkin, 1998). here, it is noteworthy the current editor of lq, john antonakis (2019), pre- dicted that  10 years from now, the typical leadership design using ques- tionnaire measures of leadership style to predict outcomes, whether objective or not, will be used less and less and there will be more of a focus on objectively measured behavior, real-time and archival. at this time overall the field in general does not yet fully recognize or appreciate that typical questionnaire-type designs do not have much to offer in terms of policy implications.  while alternative measures, such as content analysis (5.5%), diary studies, and event sampling (0.7%) continue to be under-utilized, new measures have been introduced to the field that may foreshadow this predicted replacement of survey-based research. these include implicit measures (chong, djurdjevic, & johnson, 2017), facial expression  w.l. gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  22    coding (trichas, 2017; trichas, schyns, lord, & hall, 2017), biosensor measures (cook & meyer, 2017; dixon, webb, & chang, 2017), com- puter-assisted textual analysis (cata; davis & gardner, 2012; short, broberg, cogliser, & brigham, 2010), and social network measures (cullen-lester & yammarino, 2016). given the availability and promise of such measures, the time is ripe for researchers to heed this call and wean themselves from their overreliance on retrospective surveys. we also expect that the editorial board and the journal\\'s leadership would welcome methodological pieces that introduce why and how these types of novel approaches could advance leadership research.  a second methodological recommendation advanced by gardner et al. (2010, p. 951) involves conducting more research using multiple studies (e.g., study 1, study 2, etc.) “that richly and methodologically demonstrate how a leadership phenomenon unfolds.” our findings re- vealed progress in reaching this goal during lq\\'s third decade, parti- cularly during 2018, for which the average was 1.25 studies for every lq article published. we are optimistic that this trend will continue, as reviewers and editors alike call for greater multi-study research to more fully flesh out leadership processes and rule out competing explanations for the relationships identified. this does not mean that we believe articles that answer “big” questions are not called for. instead, we be- lieve that multi-study work can answer big questions a piece at a time, yielding a stronger demonstration (perhaps even replicated ones) of the leadership phenomenon of interest.  a third recommendation offered by gardner et al. (2010, p. 951) called for “research teams combining psychologists, sociologists, an- thropologists, and cognitive scientists who can bring multiple per- spectives and methodologies to the formation of research questions and tests of hypotheses.” in this review we coded author discipline, with the results summarized in table 9. the findings revealed that roughly two- thirds of authors are affiliated with management departments, and 22.1% with psychology departments, leaving only 10% for other dis- ciplines. while we did not code for interdisciplinary teams per se, it is clear that gardner and colleagues\\' call for such teams has not been answered, given the over-representation of management and psy- chology faculty among lq authors. on the one hand, given the in- creasing diversification of lq\\'s editorial leadership and review board, it would not be surprising to find that some of these scholars partner to investigate leadership phenomena from a multi-disciplinary perspective in the future, or that authors from diverse disciplines respond to the signal sent by lq\\'s increasingly diverse disciplinary editorial leadership and editorial board that such research would be welcome. on the other hand, given well-entrenched barriers that exist to discourage inter- disciplinary and transdisciplinary research (hadorn et al., 2008), we also would not be surprised if it remains relatively rare. regardless of the level of interdisciplinary leadership research conducted, we echo gardner et al.\\'s (2010) call for more interdisciplinary teams to produce novel perspectives and approaches to studying leadership.  gardner et al.\\'s (2010, p. 951) fourth recommendation called for “the foci of cross-level studies to move toward understanding how leadership is enacted and evaluated at different levels simultaneously.” indeed, batistič, černe, and vogel (2017) found that the leadership field remains fragmented, with only certain leadership models (shared leadership, trust, complexity, context, and emotions/emotional intelligence) cur- rently employing a levels-of-analysis approach for both their leadership conceptualizations and associated outcomes (while other models such as transformational leadership are declining in their multi-level study). accordingly, while we have witnessed a continuing increase in multi- level research in our review, as our prior discussion of lowe and gardner\\'s (2000) suggestions indicated, we believe it is time for the field to take gardner et al.\\'s (2010, p. 951) recommendation to “treat cross- level understanding of the phenomena as foreground and thereby make partialing the statistical variance background when our goal is to under- stand the effects of leaders and leadership at different levels.” this charge to the field is further bolstered by a number of multi-level approach recommendations made more recently in batistič et al. (2017).  the fifth recommendation made by gardner et al. (2010) calls for greater use of controlled experiments to tease out causal relationships among the antecedents and consequences of leadership. as noted in our discussion of research methods, lq\\'s third decade has been character- ized by more extensive use of experimental methods, as the proportion of studies that employed such methods rose substantially in lq\\'s third decade relative to the prior two. perhaps this increase is in partial re- sponse to antonakis et al.\\'s (2010) call at the beginning of the decade for more experimental research to address pervasive endogeneity con- cerns that have plagued the leadership field, as well as the social sci- ences in general. nonetheless, we observed little use of the types of quasi-experimental research antonakis et al. advocated. given the di- versity and the utility of quasi-experimental studies for ascertaining causal relations (cook & campbell, 1979), we echo the calls of anto- nakis and others (antonakis, 2017, b; antonakis et al., 2010; grant & wall, 2009) for greater usage of this powerful methodology.  the sixth recommendation made by gardner et al. (2010) called for the use of alternative methodologies from other fields of study, such as behavioral economics, narrative analytical techniques developed by sociologists, and computer simulations pioneered by psychologists. as we noted in our discussion of measures, the field of leadership has in- creasingly borrowed from other disciplines to introduce more novel approaches to studying leadership phenomena (schyns, hall, & neves, 2017). in addition, the appointment of aes from a wider array of dis- ciplines including economics, evolutionary psychology, and political science, as well the publication of special issues that demonstrate the utility of methods from the fields of biology (van vugt, 2018), neu- roscience (lee et al., 2012; van vugt, 2018) and economics (garretsen, stoker, & weber, 2016) for studying leadership, suggests that the field is poised to embrace a host of methods from other disciplines.  the seventh recommendation advanced by gardner et al. (2010) involved a call to test competing models through data analysis. while our coding provides little insight into the extent to which this occurred, our impression from reading the 615 articles published during lq\\'s third decade is that such comparisons remain rare. nonetheless, recent meta-analyses by banks, mccauley, gardner, and guler (2016) and hoch, bommer, dulebohn, and wu (2018) that compared the predictive utility of authentic, ethical, servant, and transformational leadership demonstrate the value of such comparative analyses. we encourage leadership researchers to follow these examples to conduct more ex- tensive comparisons of leadership theories to assess their predictive power and their boundary conditions.  gardner et al.\\'s (2010) eighth recommendation is to devote greater attention to the cognitive aspects of leaders and leadership. it appears that progress has been made in this regard, as leader and follower cognitions, implicit leadership theories, identity and identification processes, social identity theory, and information processing and deci- sion making–all focal theories that involve cognitive pro- cesses—combined to account for 11.3% of focal theories. additionally, three special issues were dedicated to leadership and cognition (foti, hansbrough, epitropaki, & coyle, 2017; lee et al., 2012; mumford, watts, & partlow, 2015). despite such progress, the fundamental im- portance of leader and follower cognitions to the perception, emer- gence, and enactment of leadership highlights the need for continuing research in this domain.  finally, gardner et al. (2010) recommended that researchers draw more extensively on technology to generate new insights into leader- ship phenomena. as previously noted, our findings suggest that while retrospective surveys continue to dominate as measures of leadership, new applications of technology are gaining traction that promise to expand our methodological tool chest including measures of facial ex- pressions (poutvaara, 2014; trichas, 2017; trichas et al., 2017), bio- sensors (dixon et al., 2017), implicit measures (chong et al., 2017), computer-assisted textual analysis (cata; davis & gardner, 2012; short et al., 2010), and social network measures (cullen-lester & yammarino, 2016).  w.l. gardner, et al. the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101379  23    editor interviews  in addition to revisiting the content and methodological re- commendations from prior reviews, we also interviewed, for purposes of this manuscript, mike mumford, leanne atwater, and john antonakis, each of whom served as editor-in-chief during some portion of the leadership quarterly\\'s third decade. the editor interviews re- inforced several of the themes discussed previously and also introduced new topics. while a full discussion of the rich insights provided is be- yond the scope of this manuscript, we briefly highlight ten themes.  one theme raised by the editors involved the need to pay more attention to context (e.g. healthcare, education) as a boundary condi- tion on our theories rather than searching for a single moderated mediation model that can explain it all. a second theme was the need to continue to reduce an overreliance on survey research utilizing mea- sures that are underspecified for the richness of the phenomenon they seek to measure. a third theme, related to the preceding point, is the need to broaden the methods employed including increased usage of simulations, robust experimental designs, and qualitative research methods. a fourth theme was a general concern about construct pro- liferation in the field. the increase in construct proliferation was per- ceived to be at least, in part, driven by journals insisting on new the- oretical development as normative. in contrast to pushing for the development of new theory, a general sentiment was that devoting si- milar effort to the development of better measurement of the constructs currently in place, and more robust research designs to tease out the nuances and boundary conditions of existing theories, would better serve the field at this juncture. a fifth theme involved a recognition that more needs to be done to understand how leadership demands are si- milar, and different, at upper-middle and upper echelons of the orga- nization. the editors noted that our current knowledge, which has largely been obtained from middle level managers and lower level su- pervisors, is better suited to informing undergraduates and other early career workers. related to this concern is that the reporting of leader- ship research findings generally ignores both responsibility level in the organization and the context in which leadership is practiced. this challenge is exacerbated by one-size-fits-all theories that provide rela- tively little guidance on the boundary conditions across contexts and responsibility levels.  a sixth theme was the need to better understand the implications of increasingly non-western samples in leadership research explored pre- dominately through the lens of theory developed in first world, anglo- centric organizations. while the general feeling is that construct pro- liferation and consistent pushes for new theoretical development may not have served the field well, the need for theory development in non- western settings or from non-western lenses may be a needed exception. a seventh theme was the need to better integrate disciplinary per- spectives on leadership. for example, psychology researchers typically frame leadership as an outcome variable, whereas organizational be- havior researchers typically frame leadership as a predictor variable. an eighth theme was the need to better understand how technology, especially the role of social media and the potential to be constantly connected, is challenging how we define leadership and what is ex- pected from leaders. the use of artificial intelligence and deep learning will also be on the uptake, challenging both our understanding of lea- dership and redefining the challenges leaders face. a ninth theme was to provide more attention to how changing social norms influence leadership challenges. as a recent example, the “#metoo” movement both raised social awareness and challenged social norms of often quietly condoned behavior. at the same time the heightened attention gave rise to new forms of backlash in cross-gender relationships. thus, gender and gendered dynamics specifically, and diversity in general, will continue to require more attention than the field has generally afforded the topics. finally, a tenth theme reflected a need to better link effective leadership to organizational outcomes. leadership is generally posited as one method for improving organizational-level performance.  yet most leadership research focuses on individual level (leader) per- formance or the relationship of leader behavior on group- (team-) level performance. as a field, we have little evidence that these individual- and group-level outcomes cumulatively increase organizational per- formance. thus, developing theories and measures of how leadership systems impact the performance of organizational systems remains a challenge for the field.  conclusion  since its founding in 1990, the leadership quarterly has provided three decades of leadership for theory and research into the study and practice of leadership phenomena. while our review of the content and methodological recommendations offered in the reviews of lq\\'s first and second decades revealed areas where only limited progress had been made, it also revealed many encouraging developments. based on our assessment of lq\\'s third decade of publications, we conclude that it is fulfilling its mission to advance “our understanding of leadership as a phenomenon, how to study it, as well as its practical implications” while studying “leaders from all walks of social life” and publishing “scholarly research, theory, and developmental application from di- verse fields of inquiry about leadership” (https://www.journals. elsevier.com/the-leadership-quarterly). we also find that lq\\'s record of publishing rigorous and innovative research during its first three decades provides a basis for optimism that the journal, and the field, will continue to expand our knowledge of leaders and leadership into new frontiers. we look forward, with optimistic anticipation, to the story lq\\'s fourth decade will tell about the evolution and study of leadership.  references  antonakis, j.

evolution: using dual-strategies theory to explain leadership in modern organizations  kaylene j. mcclanahan kellogg school of management, northwestern university, united states of america  a b s t r a c t  research from multiple fields suggests that throughout human history, leaders ascended the hierarchy through one of two strategies—dominance (using force or coercion to gain control) or prestige (demonstrating competence and generosity so others follow of their own volition). the dual-strategies theory of social rank suggests that these two strategies are still inherent in human psychology, and that consideration of dominance and prestige can help explain hierarchy and leadership in modern social groups. thus far, research on dual-strategies theory has developed without significant cross-fertilization from the literature on leadership within organizational settings. in this review, i provide the first examination of dual-strategies theory within the context of broader leadership research, highlighting a) the unique contributions of dual-strategies theory, b) current workforce trends that make dual-strategies theory particularly applicable to modern organizations, and c) key limitations of dual-strategies theory that could be addressed by integrating leadership theory.  in the last two decades, evolutionary social psychologists have proposed a new framework for classifying and thinking about in- dividuals\\' approaches to social hierarchy. this framework—the dual- strategies theory of social rank—suggests that attempts to gain and maintain positions of high social rank can be categorized as one of two strategies: dominance or prestige (maner & case, 2016). a dominant style is characterized by the use of force or coercion to claim social power. in contrast, a prestige-based approach typically involves de- monstrating valued traits such as competence and generosity so others follow the leader of their own volition. this theory is gaining traction in social and evolutionary psychology, as evidenced by the number of papers in this area published in top psychology journals over the past decade (e.g., case, bae, & maner, 2018; case & maner, 2014; cheng & tracy, 2013; cheng, tracy, foulsham, kingstone, & henrich, 2013; halevy, chou, cohen, & livingston, 2012; maner & mead, 2010; witkower, tracy, cheng, & henrich, in press; see case & maner, 2016 and maner, 2017 for reviews).  despite asking similar questions, research on dual-strategies theory has thus far developed without significant cross-fertilization from the larger body of research on leadership in organizations. in the following, i address the divide between these two literatures by providing the first examination of the dual-strategies theory of social rank within the context of broader leadership theory. the aim of this review is to in- troduce dual-strategies theory to leadership researchers who may be unfamiliar with it, clarify the unique contributions of the dual-strate- gies theory of social rank, and describe the potential benefits of cross- fertilization from these two literatures. finally, i argue that although dual-strategies theory has not been extensively studied in  organizational settings, it is a particularly useful theory for under- standing many modern employment contexts.  in order to situate the dual-strategies theory of social rank within the context of the broader leadership theory and research, i first define social rank, power, status, and leadership. next, i briefly introduce the dual-strategies theory of social rank, including the intellectual tradi- tions that gave birth to the theory. with this introduction complete, i take three steps to position this theory within the context of the orga- nizational behavior literature on leadership. first, i describe a few of the most prominent leadership theories and compare and contrast these theories with dual-strategies theory. second, i describe the unique focus and contributions of dual-strategies theory relative to organizational behavior literature on leadership and argue that this theory offers un- ique explanatory value that is increasingly pertinent to the modern workforce. third, to demonstrate how principles from the broader re- search on literature can provide fertile theoretical ground for future research within dual-strategies theory, i take a few select concepts from the literature on leadership and describe how they can be applied to dual-strategies theory to generate and answer important empirical questions.  defining key terms  definitions of leadership, social rank, power, and status are plen- tiful, varied, and seldom agreed upon (bass & bass, 2008; blader & chen, 2014; northouse, 2018). given that this review draws from lit- erature in organizational behavior, social psychology, and evolutionary anthropology, all of whom use these terms differently, defining each of

bodies of literature relate to each other.  social rank  the concept of social rank is central to dual-strategies theory and is defined as one\\'s position within a hierarchy, where hierarchy is a “rank order of individuals or groups on a valued social dimension” (magee & galinsky, 2008, p. 354). a person with high social rank is a person with a position near the top of the hierarchy.  there are a few points worth clarifying about this conception of social rank. first, a person\\'s social rank is relative: it depends on their immediate reference group. for example, in formal organizational hierarchies, many employees serve as both managers and sub- ordinates—a manager might be in a position of high social rank when interfacing with her subordinates, but might have average or even low social rank when interacting with other managers in firm. second, hierarchies can be either formal or informal: a job title conveys an in- dividual\\'s position within the organization\\'s formal hierarchy, but cer- tain individuals might also be informally deferred to more than others with the same job title, giving them a higher position within the in- formal hierarchy. similarly, even in social groups where there is no formal hierarchy—for example, a book club—informal hierarchies often emerge: a book club member who makes insightful contributions to the discussion and has an outsized influence on book selection might be considered to have high social rank despite his/her lack of formal title. third, within a given social group, multiple hierarchies can, and generally do, exist (greer & van kleef, 2010). in other words, in- dividuals may be ranked on different dimensions. for example, one member of a work team might be considered a leader in technical ex- pertise, while another is considered a leader in client engagement. social rank can refer to one\\'s location on one of these specific dimen- sions or the aggregate of all possible hierarchies. finally, hierarchies can be characterized by power or status (hays & bendersky, 2015), a distinction described in more detail below.  power and status theory and empirical research suggest that power and status re-  present distinct types of social rank and therefore are related but dis- tinct constructs (anicich, fast, halevy, & galinsky, 2016; bendersky & hays, 2012; fast, halevy, & galinsky, 2012). this distinction is im- portant to understanding dual-strategies theory (case, bae, & maner, 2018; maner & case, 2016).  power is the asymmetric control of valued resources in social re- lationships (galinsky, rucker, & magee, 2015; magee & galinsky, 2008). a key feature of power is the asymmetry between group mem- bers: because the powerful control important resources, group members with less power are dependent upon them (galinsky et al., 2015). in contrast, the powerful remain less dependent on others to get what they want. additionally, individuals can hold power by either controlling resources that are desirable (i.e., an individual has a resource that group members want access to) or that are undesirable (i.e., an in- dividual controls negative outcomes, such as punishment or cost-in- flicting tasks, that group members seek to avoid; magee & galinsky, 2008). both of these reflect the asymmetric dependence and resource control that characterize power-based hierarchies.  in contrast to the control focus of power, status refers to “the re- spect, admiration, and voluntary deference an individual is afforded by others” (anderson, hildreth, & howland, 2015, p. 575). crucially, status is in the eye of the perceivers: one cannot “seize” status the way one could “seize” power, as it is only granted by other members of the group (blader & chen, 2014). some organizational behavior research designates status as formal positions of power and esteem as the ad- miration and respect of others (cf. bass & bass, 2008), but this is in- consistent with how the term “status” is used in social psychology (and this review). rather, research on social rank defines status as to  something closer to what these researchers would call “esteem.” the distinction between power and status is important because  there is significant evidence that power and status are conferred sepa- rately (fast et al., 2012; galinsky et al., 2015), that power and status hierarchies function differently (bendersky & hays, 2012; hays & bendersky, 2015), and that the experience of having power has fun- damentally different psychological and behavioral consequences than having status (e.g., anicich et al., 2016; blader & chen, 2012; fast et al., 2012). this distinction is also important to dual-strategies theory, as several researchers have linked dominance with power and prestige with status (cf. case et al., 2018; maner & case, 2016; ronay, maddux, & von hippel, 2018). nevertheless, power and status frequently co- occur (blader & chen, 2014). unless specified, the term “social rank” is agnostic to the type of hierarchy: a person with high social rank can have power, status, or both.  leadership  while definitions of leadership are plentiful (northouse, 2018), one consistently agreed upon theme is that leadership represents a complex, multi-faceted group process by which an individual influences the group toward their goals (avolio, walumbwa, & weber, 2009; bass & bass, 2008; hogan & kaiser, 2005; kantner, 2010; lord, day, zaccaro, avolio, & eagly, 2017; northouse, 2018). it is important to note that leadership does not refer to a position of high social rank: an individual with high social rank may be in a position to lead others, but that does not necessarily mean he or she will do so (blader & chen, 2014).  dual strategies (not leadership styles) the dual-strategies theory of social rank focuses on the psycholo-  gical and behavioral strategies that individuals employ to attain and maintain a position of high social rank, as well as the implications of these strategies for the group. in this way, the theory focuses on ap- proaches to hierarchy, and not necessarily the complex, multifaceted, and reciprocal processes of leadership. for this reason, dominance and prestige are not leadership styles, but rather reflect strategies by which individuals attempt to gain and maintain positions of social rank. some might assume from the word “strategy” that these behaviors are in- tentional, premediated, and/or machiavellian, but this is not necessa- rily the case: individuals might engage in either of these strategies without even consciously considering their position within the hier- archy.  although dual-strategies theory is not a theory of leadership per se, understanding how social hierarchies are formed, maintained, or dis- rupted is an important component of understanding leadership in or- ganizations. thus, dual-strategies theory can be used in conjunction with extant leadership theories to better explain leadership, follower- ship, and hierarchies in modern organizations or social groups broadly. (i explore the potential integration of dual-strategies theory and lea- dership theory in more detail in the section entitled “dual-strategies theory and classic leadership theories.”) additionally, many phe- nomena investigated by leadership researchers (for example, leadership emergence or how leaders and followers navigate compliance) are squarely within the domain of dual-strategies theory. because of this, an integration of leadership research and dual-strategies theory is likely to enrich both lines of research and prevent unnecessary duplication of research efforts.  finally, although “leadership” refers to a complex, multiparty pro- cess, in the social psychological and anthropological research on hier- archy, it is typical to use the word “leader” to mean a person with high social rank. throughout this paper, i use the term leader to this effect (and do not intend to evoke or comment on the complexity of the process of leadership when using this term).  k.j. mcclanahan the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101315  2    introduction to the dual-strategies theory of social rank  the dual-strategies theory of social rank is a theoretical perspective on hierarchy based in evolutionary psychology and anthropology.1  evolutionary psychology is a scientific line of inquiry that suggests that human psychology is (at least in part) a reflection of our ancestral history (buss, 2005; cosmides & tooby, 1992). one key tenet of evo- lutionary psychology is that a comprehensive understanding of human psychology requires an investigation into the conditions and selection pressures to which humans evolved: by understanding the social en- vironments to which our brains adapted, we gain additional insights into human psychology and behavior. an evolutionary approach to hierarchy and leadership specifically means considering the selective pressures and adaptive problems solved by groups and leaders during human evolution. thus, insights into modern hierarchies can be gained by considering the groups and hierarchies of the human environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or eea.  the human eea refers to the conditions to which we are humans evolved. while it is impossible to pinpoint a singular environment or time period that could reflect the complexity of human evolution, the eea represents the “composite of environment properties” (tooby & cosmides, 1990, p. 388) that were present when humans evolved to their current form. it is hypothesized that most uniquely human traits evolved during the pleistocene era, which spanned from approximately 2.5 million years ago to approximately 12,000 years ago (symons, 1992). during this time period, human social groups were quite dif- ferent from our modern context—they tended to be small, kin-based, and relatively egalitarian (van vugt, hogan, & kaiser, 2008). hierarchy tended to be informal, domain-specific, and marked by constant shifts (henrich & gil-white, 2001; van vugt et al., 2008). an investigation into these groups, as well as human selection pressures and ancestral environments that evoked them, provides a variety of fascinating questions and potential insights for leadership research (see garfield, von rueden, & hagen, 2019 or van vugt et al., 2008 for reviews).  the dual-strategies theory of social rank, however, focuses on one interesting dichotomy that has been noted by the ethologists, biologists, and evolutionary anthropologists who study these groups. specifically, they noted that, “leaders sometimes engage in dominant behaviors that often benefit themselves at the expense of the group, and sometimes provide information- and skill-based services that benefit both them- selves and the group” (garfield et al., 2019, p. 74). dual-strategies theory suggests that this dichotomy between the use of force at the expense of the group (termed a dominant strategy) and the use of knowledge and skill to benefit the group (termed a prestige strategy) is at the core to understanding how individuals attain and maintain po- sitions of influence in social groups.  dominance  hierarchies characterized by dominance typically feature in- dividuals who try to force and manipulate their way to positions at the top of the hierarchy (not unlike the hierarchies of most great apes; maner, 2017; tiger & fox, 1972). the dominance approach is  characterized by intimidation, coercion, and manipulation of group resources. dominant individuals are primarily interested in acquiring and retaining positions of power (vs. status; maner & case, 2016), and often prioritize this interest above the interests of the group (maner & mead, 2010). additionally, dominant leaders\\' preoccupation with their own standing within the group means they tend to be hyper-vigilant to other group members who might pose a threat to their aspirations of power (case & maner, 2014; maner & case, 2016). dominant leaders are also more likely to subjugate their group members in order to in- crease the power differential between them and their followers. in other words, dominance is a hierarchy-enhancing strategy (maner & case, 2016).  why might individuals allow a dominant individual to lead the group despite his/her selfish behavior? scholars have identified at least four reasons why dominance hierarchies might emerge. first, a dom- inance hierarchy can prevent constant conflict over resources: a widely known and accepted pecking order provides clear rules and expecta- tions for how resources will be distributed among group members (drews, 1993). this can prevent constant in-fighting every time group resources need to be distributed. while being at the bottom of a dom- inance hierarchy may bear some cost, it can provide benefits to the group as a whole by preventing chaos.  second, dominance can provide increased coordination among group members, making dominance particularly valuable in situations in which a high degree of coordination is necessary for the group to survive or flourish—one such context being times of intergroup conflict (king, johnson, & van vugt, 2009). indeed, during times of intergroup conflict, dominant leaders subjugate their own interests for the good of the group (fortunato & gavrilets, 2014; maner & mead, 2010) and aggressively defend the group\\'s welfare (laustsen & petersen, 2017). in these ways (or in these contexts), dominant leaders can provide im- portant benefits to the group (garfield et al., 2019).  third, another function that leaders serve is keeping group members in line and punishing free-riders (those who fail to complete their duty to the group; de cremer & van vugt, 2002). that is, a leader is re- sponsible for punishing potentially exploitative group members (lukaszewski, simmons, anderson, & roney, 2016), discouraging de- fection (von rueden, 2014), and arbitrating conflict between group members (von rueden & gurven, 2012). group members may see dominant leaders\\' willingness to use force as an asset in this regard: they may be seen as more capable of protecting the group from those who would undermine or exploit group cooperation.  a final explanation for the emergence of dominant leader is more pessimistic about the benefits of dominant leaders, but rather suggests that dominant leader is more likely to attain and retain a position of high social rank when group members have limited outside alternatives to the dominant leader (hirschman, 1970; price & van vugt, 2014). that is, dominant leadership might flourish when group members are highly dependent on their leader, do not have good outside alternatives, or lack the ability to revolt (ronay, oostrom, & maner, under review). in these contexts, the leader may have more leeway to engage in coercive, selfish behavior (price & van vugt, 2014) that would typically cause group members to reject the leader (boehm, 1993).  prestige  in contrast to force-based dominance hierarchies, hierarchies can also be based on prestige—in our ancestral past, talented hunters or other skilled group members were deferred to because of their valued experience, skills, and ability to mentor and help others (henrich & gil- white, 2001). thus, a prestige-based strategy typically involves at- taining social rank by amassing the respect, admiration, and “freely conferred deference” of one\\'s subordinates rather than through active subjugation of others (henrich & gil-white, 2001, p. 165). prestige- oriented individuals tend to demonstrate competence and expertise, which other group members value and admire (anderson & kilduff,  1 while dual-strategies theory has been championed by evolutionary psy- chologists in the last decade, it is important to note that this work has drawn heavily on the work of anthropologists, biologists, primatologists, and etholo- gists more broadly. indeed, researchers in these areas had been discussing the evolutionary origins of human hierarchies for decades prior to the adoption of these ideas by evolutionary social psychologists. anthropological research specifically spoke of dominance hierarchies in humans (tiger & fox, 1972), prestige as a form of hierarchy (barkow, 1989) and/or a distinction between force-based and persuasion-based attempts at social rank (kracke, 1978). given this, the work on dual-strategies theory lead by evolutionary psychologists does not necessarily represent an innovative new idea, but rather a conciliation and advancement of ideas from several different intellectual domains.  k.j. mcclanahan the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101315  3    2009). importantly, however, demonstrating competence alone is generally not enough to elicit respect and deference—group members must also feel confident that the potential leader will use his or her skills to benefit the group (anderson et al., 2015; hardy & van vugt, 2006). thus, a prestige strategy is thought to involve demonstration of expertise and magnanimity, so that other group members willingly defer to the potential leader (maner, 2017; maner & case, 2016; willer, 2009). while dominant leaders tend to assert themselves and their will on other group members, prestige oriented leaders tend to display both prosocial behavior and knowledge and expertise in specific topic areas, increasing their trustworthiness and value in the eyes of others (chudek & henrich, 2011; maner & case, 2016). one other reason that followers might defer to prestige-oriented leaders is that prestige-based leaders tend to be relatively egalitarian (henrich & gil-white, 2001), which is thought to be preferable for most followers (harms, wood, landay, lester, & lester, 2017; van vugt et al., 2008).  patterns of prestige-based deference generally benefitted both the leader and follower (price & van vugt, 2014). followers were able to learn valuable information from successful individuals and also bene- fited from having a competent leader make group decisions (hagen & garfield, 2019). in turn, followers tended to offer deference and pres- tige to these successful individuals. although a prestige-based strategy often required the leader to sacrifice for the good of the group (price & van vugt, 2014; willer, 2009), the leader was generally repaid with high social rank, which translated into an increased ability to attain personal goals, control resources, and influence others (maner & case, 2016).  although some scholars debate the precise mechanism by which dominance and prestige strategies were transmitted from generation to generation (be it psychological adaptation, cultural group selection, or a combination of both; see chudek & henrich, 2011; maner, 2017; richerson et al., 2016; richerson & henrich, 2012), there is abundant evidence that both strategies exists across a variety of contexts and cultures (garfield et al., 2019; kracke, 1978)2 which is typically con- sidered to be a major calling card of evolved human adaptations (schmitt & pilcher, 2004). furthermore, it is clear that (at least in some contexts) both of these strategies provided benefits to both leaders and followers. evolutionary psychologists suggest that when social inter- actions provide a net fitness benefit to the individuals within a group (in this case, both leaders and followers), these patterns of interaction are likely to persist and evolve (tooby & cosmides, 1992). at a high level, this explains how dominance and prestige-based hierarchies came to be widespread.  in short, the dual-strategies theory of social rank suggests that due to the pervasiveness of dominance and prestige in our evolutionary  past, the proclivity toward these strategies is still inherent in our psy- chology. consequently, the dual-strategies theory of social rank sug- gests that even today, attempts to both attain and maintain positions of high social rank can be categorized into one of two distinct strategies: dominance or prestige (cheng & tracy, 2014; henrich & gil-white, 2001; maner, 2017; maner & case, 2016). furthermore, while dom- inance and prestige are very different approaches to gaining and maintaining high social rank, dual-strategies theory suggests that both strategies are effective ways of attaining social rank, representing “two ways to the top” (cheng et al., 2013).3  dominance and prestige as individual tendencies  dual-strategies theory suggests that while dominance and prestige are strategies for obtaining social rank, they can also reflect individual differences between individuals (maner & case, 2016). that is, while it would be feasible for a person to enact a dominant strategy at one time and a prestige-based strategy at another time, it is hypothesized that people tend to gravitate toward one strategy over the other. in this way, the terms “dominant” and “prestige-oriented” can also be applied to a person who consistently deploys one of the strategies.  research on dominance and prestige from an evolutionary psy- chology perspective suggests that this individual difference can also be conceptualized as a difference in motives in addition to a difference in behavior (maner & case, 2016). specifically, maner and case (2016) suggest that dominance is a reflection of the motivation for power, and prestige-orientation reflects a motivation for status.4 this difference in motivation could explain a key difference in the psychology of dom- inance- and prestige-oriented individuals. status is inherently other- focused—gaining status necessitates that you consider the needs of others, as you depend on them to give you status (anderson et al., 2015). in contrast, power is something that can be taken—other group members can be managed or manipulated in pursuit of resources or control (barkow, 1989). given this, it follows that dominant leaders would be inherently less focused on how others view them.  2 one common and related debate in the study of human evolution is whether a given characteristic is uniquely human. there is a myriad of evidence that dominance hierarchies predate humans and are found across a myriad of spe- cies and genera, so there is no doubt that dominance is not uniquely human. researchers have debated whether prestige hierarchies are uniquely human. while this question does not significantly impact the application of dual-stra- tegies theory to modern organizations, it may be of interest to note that some researchers argue that prestige-based hierarchies are present in non-human primates, because chimpanzees demonstrate social learning from higher ranking chimpanzees (horner, proctor, bonnie, whiten, & de waal, 2010; kendal et al., 2015). indeed, many species rely on more informed group members to make decisions for the group, including elephants (payne, 2003), whales (brent et al., 2015), and birds (flack et al., 2018). however, other re- searchers argue that prestige hierarchies in humans are distinct from the knowledge-based hierarchies of non-human animals. this argument is relies on the notion that a) prestige-based social learning in humans is far more complex than the basic info-copying seen in other mammals (henrich & gil-white, 2001) and b) prestige includes the learning of norms and culture passed down through generations (with culture transmission considered by many to be a uniquely human trait; henrich et al., 2015), that prestige hierarchies in humans are distinct from the knowledge-based hierarchies of non-human animals.  3 yet another debate in this area revolves around how distinct dominance and prestige are. despite early anthropological work noting the dichotomy of strategies in obtaining positions of social rank (kracke, 1978), other anthro- pologists such as sahlins (1963) did not differentiate between the strategies, suggesting that social rank in small-scale societies was attained through a combination of both of cunning aggression and prestige. furthermore, chapais (2015) argues that all social rank is attained through competence, and that dominance and prestige simply reflect competence in different domains. cha- pais also argues that because chimpanzee hierarchies include both forced-based coercion and competence-based attraction to high-ranking individuals, the two strategies may have more overlap in terms of evolutionary origins than pre- viously thought. despite these claims, there is considerable evidence that dominance and prestige hierarchies result in distinct group processes (e.g., garfield, hubbard, & hagen, 2019; hays & bendersky, 2015), and that domi- nant and prestige-based leaders have distinct psychologies and behavior (see maner & case, 2016 for a review). despite this, it is worth noting that in at least some samples, self-reported dominance and prestige motivations are positively correlated (e.g., case & maner, 2014), though peer-reported prestige and dominance strategies tend not to be (cheng et al., 2013). see the section on “dominance and prestige as individual tendencies” below for further discus- sion on this distinction.  4 while motivation for power/status has been theorized to drive a tendency toward a dominance or prestige influence strategy, other work from evolu- tionary anthropology and evolutionary psychology points out that the strategy an individual employs is likely a reflection of their inherent resources and capabilities as well. (lukaszewski et al., 2016; von rueden, 2014, 2016). for example, if an individual does not have the resources to use force or control others, a dominant strategy is likely to be ineffective. if an individual does not possess relevant or valued skills or knowledge, a prestige strategy is unlikely to be effective (brand & mesoudi, 2019). thus, in addition to underlying motives for status vs. power, individuals likely employ strategies that are more likely to be efficacious for them.  k.j. mcclanahan the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101315  4    it should be noted, however, that the other-oriented focus of pres- tige leaders could be, but is not necessarily, a sign of prosocial mo- tives—it is possible that prestige-oriented leaders are preoccupied with their own self-interest (gaining status), but are required to think about others and act prosocially in order to obtain this status. indeed, there is much evidence that in many human contexts prosociality (or as least a lack of self-interest) is rewarded with social status (bai, ching, ho, & yan, 2019; flynn, reagans, amanatullah, & ames, 2006; hardy & van vugt, 2006; willer, 2009; willer, youngreen, troyer, & lovaglia, 2012). those who violate cooperative norms by displaying selfishness are punished (peterson, 1993), ostracized (feinberg, willer, & schultz, 2014), or suffer damaged reputations after being the target of gossip (hess & hagen, 2019; wu, balliet, & van lange, 2016). (this, of course, assumes that group members have the resources to overthrow a selfish leader; woodburn, 2011.) thus, prestige-focused individuals may (correctly) assume that they must focus on the needs of others in order to get what they want: status.  consistent with this idea, there is some evidence that prestige-or- iented leaders have a tendency to pander to the desires of other group members. when faced with making a popular choice which is not ideal for the group or an unpopular choice that would be good for the group, prestige- (but not dominance-) oriented leaders are likely to make a popular choice, even if it will negatively impact group performance (case et al., 2018). it is not clear if this pandering is a reflection of prestige-oriented leaders\\' concerns about their own status or their de- sire to maintain positive relationships with others, but this does suggest that a) prosocial individuals care about what others think of them and b) that they sometimes let their own motives take precedence over what is best for the group (case, bae, & maner, 2019). it is important to note that while dominance and prestige may seem like incompatible stra- tegies, self-reports on dominance and prestige motivations are often positively correlated, though peer-ratings and objectively-coded mea- sures of dominance and prestige tend not to be positively correlated in (cheng et al., 2013). this is somewhat unsurprising, given that ob- servers often rely on inaccurate markers of prestige (jiménez & mesoudi, 2019). however, it does indicate that while the same in- dividual might be motivated by both dominance and prestige, others perceive their behavioral strategies to follow just one of the two stra- tegies (at least at a given time). adding to the complexity, the style an individual adopts (and how other group members respond to this style) is likely to be driven by contextual factors, including intergroup conflict (laustsen & petersen, 2015, 2017; spisak, blaker, lefevre, moore, & krebbers, 2014), resource inequality (ronay et al., 2018), or economic uncertainty (kakkar & sivanathan, 2017).  dual-strategies theory and classic leadership theories  while research on leadership is vast, much of it has revolved around common themes. how does a leader exact compliance from her sub- ordinates? how important is a leader\\'s socio-emotional intelligence? how can a leader balance task and relational concerns? many of these questions are also at the heart of the dual-strategies theory of social rank. for this reason, it is important to consider the dual-strategies theory of social rank within the context of the leadership research. however, to this point, there have not been any systematic attempts to integrate the two bodies of research. below, i conduct the first review of dual-strategies theory in the context of major theories about leadership with the aim of further elucidating what exactly dual-strategies theory is and how it differs from leadership research and theory. defining the theory in terms of what it is not will hopefully shed more light on what precisely it adds to the literature.  i specifically examine how the dual-strategies theory relates to the following five leadership frameworks: a) blake and mouton\\'s manage- rial grid, b) leader-member exchange, c) transformational versus transactional leadership, d) servant leadership, and e) authoritarianism versus democratic leadership. while these five frameworks certainly do  not represent the entirety of relevant leadership theory, they were se- lected because they represent some of the most prominent and studied theories in the leadership literature (bass & bass, 2008) and/or because of their thematic similarity to dominance or prestige. i briefly describe each of these theories, and then note some key ways in which they are similar to or different from dual-strategies theory. it should be noted that this review is intentionally brief—while it is possible to write at length about how the dual-strategies theory of social rank relates to each of these theories, i refrain from such an extensive comparison, as the goal is to provide a high-level picture of how dual-strategies theory of social rank relates to the field of leadership as a whole (rather than provide extensive integration with any specific theories).  blake and mouton\\'s managerial grid  in one of the landmark theories of leadership, blake and mouton (1964) conceptualized leadership styles in terms of a managerial grid. this grid classified leaders on two dimensions—their concern for the people they lead (relational orientation) and their concern for com- pleting group goals (task orientation). blake and mouton specified that these concepts were orthogonal, and leaders could be high on one, both, or neither dimension. thus, the managerial grid provides a convenient way of classifying leadership approaches.  dual-strategies theory bears some important similarity to the work of blake and mouton. one reasonable integration of these theories is that relational orientation is one distinction between dominance and prestige-oriented strategies. that is, dominant individuals tend to de- monstrate relatively low concern for others as they tend to be more preoccupied with their own desire to maintain or retain power (case & maner, 2014; maner & case, 2016; maner & mead, 2010). in contrast, prestige-based individuals tend to be more concerned about their re- lationships with group members than are dominant individuals (case et al., 2018; case & maner, 2014; (case, bae, & maner, 2018, 2019; maner, 2017)). in fact, this is one of the key distinctions between the strategies.  the link between dominance/prestige and task orientation is less clear. dominant individuals might be considered high on task orienta- tion because they are more concerned with pushing their own agenda rather than being diplomatic (van vugt et al., 2008) or because they may be seen as willing to punish those who do not pull their weight on accomplishing group goals (lukaszewski et al., 2016; von rueden, 2014). however, it is not clear if this agentic tendency translates to a focus on accomplishing broader group goals. there is some limited (unpublished) evidence that dominant leaders are, on average, more effective at coordinating tasks than prestige-oriented leaders, leading to better group performance when there is a need for a high degree of coordination (cheng, tracy, & henrich, in prep). this out-performance might be a reflection of dominant leaders\\' focus on the completion of group tasks, but the mechanism and motives for augmented perfor- mance is mere speculation at this point. additionally, tyrannical and authoritarian leadership (which share some similarity with dominance) have repeatedly been conceptually linked to a task orientation (einarsen, aasland, & skogstad, 2007; harms et al., 2017; tepper, 2000), but empirical evidence confirming this does not appear to exist.  it is also not clear if prestige-orientated leaders are high on task orientation. given that demonstrating competence is a hallmark of the prestige strategy, it follows that prestige-oriented leaders would need to focus on task performance in order for their strategy to be effective. indeed, there is evidence that prestige-oriented leaders tend to work harder toward group goals than their dominance-oriented counterparts (case et al., 2018). however, it is not clear if this is a reflection of their task orientation, or their desire to help or please their group members (reflecting a relational motivation).  in short, themes of blake and mouton\\'s managerial grid can be seen in dual-strategies theory. in particular, the ‘concern for others’ dimen- sion provides a great illustration of some of the differences between  k.j. mcclanahan the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101315  5    dominance and prestige as strategies. on the other hand, it is less clear how dominance and prestige might interact with task orientation, which may provide an interesting avenue for future research.  leader-member exchange  leader member exchange theorizing (graen, 1976; lmx) suggests that leaders and their individual followers interact in patterns of ex- change that both incur costs (e.g., use resources) and create value. lmx has shifted focus since its conception and early work (schriesheim, castro, & cogliser, 1999). in its early days, the theory revolved around the idea that the leader-follower relationship will be formed and maintained if the benefits for both the leader and the follower outweigh the costs (bass & bass, 2008, graen, 1976, sparrowe, 2018). interest- ingly, this cost-benefit analysis is very much in line with evolutionary perspectives on how humans determine whether a relationship is ben- eficial (sparrowe, 2018). however, in more recent research, lmx the- orizing is generally used to evoke the idea that leaders enact different leader-follower relationships with each of their followers, and that these relationships vary in quality (gerstner & day, 1997; henderson, liden, glibkowski, & chaudhry, 2009; martin, guillaume, thomas, lee, & epitropaki, 2016). for example, a leader might have a higher quality relationship with one of her five followers such that the quality of the relationship is significantly different than the leader\\'s relationship with the other followers. this differential relationship quality among dif- ferent leader-follower dyads is at the heart of current lmx research. the degree to which the leader-follower relationship quality varies from follower to follower (as opposed to being rather uniform across followers) is known as differentiation (henderson et al., 2009).  lmx differs from the dual-strategies theory in that it does not focus on the effectiveness of a leader\\'s strategies per se, but rather focuses on whether the leader-follow relationship is beneficial (or not) for the leader and follower and whether the relationship quality varies from individual to individual. this different focus means that these theories can be used in conjunction to generate new potentially interesting re- search questions and a more complete picture of hierarchy and lea- dership. for example, what might a follower see as the costs and ben- efits of having a dominant versus prestige-oriented leader? what types of follower characteristics predict high-quality relationships with a dominant or prestige-oriented leader? are dominant or prestige-or- iented leaders more likely to have high differentiation? in other words, dual-strategies theory suggests that our evolved psychology is in- herently attuned to leader and follower capacity in terms of both dominance and prestige. empirically investigating how these strategies are factored into lmx processes and relationships is likely to be an interesting and generative line of work.  additionally, lmx and dual-strategies theory share an important similarity: both theories have an explanation for leadership emergence in addition to be relevant to in established hierarchies. (this stands in contrast to the majority of leadership theory and research, which has focused on the effectiveness or consequences of leader traits/behavior after the hierarchy has already been established; bass & bass, 2008.) early work on lmx provides a theoretical explanation for leadership emergence: it suggests that a leader emerges when such an arrangement will provide more benefits to both the group and to the leader (graen, 1976). while the subsequent empirical research on lmx has largely examined exchange in established, formalized leadership contexts and thus has lacked integration with research on leadership emergence (zhang, waldman, & wang, 2012), leadership acquisition was a core focus of seminal work on this theory and thus represents a key simi- larity to dual-strategies theory.  transformational (versus transactional) leadership  a large body of leadership research has suggested that while many leaders adhere to a transaction-focused type of leadership style, some  particularly inspired leaders move beyond this to a transformational leadership style. while a transactional leadership style is characterized by leaders attempting to maintain or increase efficiency within an ex- isting set of processes, a transformational leader inspires and motivates followers through an improved or entirely new process (bass, 1999; burns, 1978). thus, a transformational leader focuses on change (derue, nahrgang, wellman, & humphrey, 2011)—they shift the cur- rent processes and relationship into something better or more fulfilling for their employees, whereas a transactional leader\\'s focus is on en- suring that employees are fulfilling their roles. a transformational leadership style has consistently been associated with gains in group performance (wang, oh, courtright, & colbert, 2011).  while a focus on enacting change is not specifically addressed in dual-strategies theory, one could theorize how dominance or prestige strategies might be associated with transformational leadership. there are several reasons to think that dominant leaders would not be inter- ested in exercising transformational leadership. first, transformational leadership is other-focused and generally prosocial in nature (bass, 1999). this is the antithesis of dominant leaders, who are more likely to view their subordinates as potential threats to their position and therefore often act in ways that actually diminish their group members\\' ability to grow (case & maner, 2014; maner & mead, 2010). concerned with keeping their own position of power, dominant leaders are more likely to try to maintain the power differential between themselves and their group—inspiring and transforming their subordinates goes against this goal. however, it should be noted that this does not necessarily mean that dominant leaders are precluded from engaging in the “large- scale change” aspect of transformational leadership—while the proso- cial elements of transformational leadership are unlikely to be posi- tively linked with dominance, changing processes or systems is not necessarily outside the purview of dominant leadership.  there are a few reasons to think that prestige‑leaders might be likely to exercise transformational leadership. first, prestige-oriented leaders tend to be more other-focused than dominant leaders (case & maner, 2014; maner & case, 2016), fitting with transformational leader\\'s pro- social aims. second, prestige-oriented leaders are thought to be inter- ested in the respect and admiration of their followers, and they might see transformational leadership as a way to gain that respect and es- teem: improving group processes might be one way to effectively de- monstrate competence and selflessness, both characteristics that are likely to evoke admiration (bai et al., 2019; bendersky & pai, 2018; willer, 2009). this is particularly likely to be the case given that transformation leadership is more difficult to enact than transactional leadership styles (bass, 1999). successfully implementing a difficult change would very likely garner more respect and status in the eyes of others.  at the same time, some have theorized that part of the draw of prestige-oriented leaders is that their leadership style is generally not seen as commandeering or demanding, decreasing the likelihood that prestige-oriented leaders are seen as power-hungry upstarts (maner & case, 2016). thus, a prestige-oriented leader might avoid making major changes to group processes as these changes might be seen as imposing their will on the group, offending egalitarian tendencies (maner & case, 2016). prestige-oriented leaders may also struggle making changes if they are concerned that such changes will upset other group members (case et al., 2018). thus, the question of whether prestige would be correlated with transformational leadership remains unclear. what is clear at this point is that the constructs can, in principle, be orthogo- nal—it is easy to imagine a prestige-oriented leader who engaged in transformational leadership and one who did not.  the integration of these theories provides for new possible research avenues. for example, does transformational leadership increase per- ceptions of a leader\\'s prestige (or dominance)? it may also be worth- while to examine the motives of transformational leaders from a dual- strategies perspective—do leaders exercise this type of leadership solely out of prosocial motives? or is transformational leadership a reflection  k.j. mcclanahan the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101315  6    of a prestige-like desire for the respect and admiration that this type of leadership might garner? interesting questions also revolve around dominance and transformational leadership. for example, while transformational leadership refers to change orientation, this change is usually assumed to be prosocial. yet there is some evidence that dominant leaders might be willing to implement changes to the group processes in ways that advantage themselves (relative to their group members). could this change-orientation be viewed as a type of anti- social transformational leadership? further exploration of this trans- formational vs. transactional leadership through the lens of dual stra- tegies theory would likely be enlightening for both literatures. finally, another opportunity for integration of these theories revolves around whether leaders change from transactional leadership to transforma- tional leadership (or vice versa) over time or depending on the contexts. if such changes occur, perhaps dual-strategies theory could explain when and why a leader might employ one of these styles.  servant leadership  servant leadership is a leadership style in which leaders “combine their motivation to lead with a need to serve” (van dierendonck, 2011, p. 1228). servant leaders are thought to focus less on the benefits of their position, but instead on benefitting their group members (greenleaf, 2004). as such, servant leaders are characterized by hu- mility, empathy, and stewardship (avolio et al., 2009) and the needs of followers are more likely to be at the forefront of their mind (stone, russell, & patterson, 2004). although the concept of servant leadership was introduced by greenleaf in 1977, serious empirical study of servant leadership has just commenced recently (van dierendonck, 2011).  even the most cursory of comparisons between dominance and servant leadership would likely elicit the conclusion that dominant leaders are not likely to enact servant leadership—in general, dom- inance leaders are more likely to focus on their own gain rather than how they can serve their group. a prestige-based strategy, on the other hand, bears significant resemblance to the concept of servant leader- ship. like servant leaders, prestige-based leaders are more likely to make significant sacrifices for the welfare of their groups and work hard to benefit other group members (case et al., 2018; price & van vugt, 2014).  however, the theorizing on prestige diverges from theorizing on servant leadership in at least two key ways. first, servant leadership does not speak to competence, and demonstrating competence is likely to be one of the key ways in which prestige-oriented leaders gain status in social groups (cheng & tracy, 2014; henrich, chudek, & boyd, 2015; henrich & gil-white, 2001). second, the motivation proscribed for self- sacrifice is differs between these theories. servant leadership theories suggest that servant leaderships sacrifice for their group members due to compassionate love (van dierendonck & patterson, 2015) and a focus on their followers (stone et al., 2004). servant leaders are attributed truly selfless motives: ‘the needs of others…[are their]…highest priority” (bass, 2000, p. 33). while prestige leaders are thought to be focused on the needs of their group members, the reason for this may ultimately be self-interested. prestige leaders may make personal sa- crifices for the group, but in return, they typically receive status (halevy, chou, & livingston, 2012; price & van vugt, 2014; willer, 2009). status is inherently valuable as it brings them preferential treatment, increased influence, and a heightened ability to accomplish their goals (price & van vugt, 2014). in this way, the sacrificial nature of prestige-based leaders may be (at least in part) designed for their own benefit (i.e., garnering respect for themselves) rather than for truly selfless reasons. supporting the idea that differing motives may be at play, servant leadership is negatively correlated with narcissism (galvin, lange, & peterson, 2012), while prestige leadership is actually positively correlated with narcissism (though prestige leaders likely actively work to suppress this narcissism to retain the esteem of their followers; cheng, tracy, & henrich, 2010).  this offers opportunities for empirical investigation. the first re- volves around whether servant leadership actually reflects true al- truism, or whether servant leadership is often prestige leadership in disguise—i.e., leaders reporting selfless motives because they know that doing so will grant them respect and admiration. another avenue re- volves around group members\\' abilities to distinguish between these two types of leadership. if truly altruistic servant leaders do exist, can group members differentiate between self-sacrificing leaders who are truly interested in the development of group members and those who are sacrificing to garner personal benefit or prestige? the ability to differentiate between these motives could be an important ability for followers, but at this point it is unclear whether people have the ca- pacity to differentiate (or whether this capacity varies from individual to individual).  authoritarianism versus democratic leadership  the degree to which leaders use force to induce compliance from their followers has long been a theme of leadership research (bass & bass, 2008). specifically, authoritarian (or autocratic) leaders—who use strength and force to ensure the group accomplishes their goal- s—are often contrasted with democratic leaders who distribute the power to make decisions among group members and include other group members in their responsibilities(harms et al., 2017). (this dis- tinction is also referred to as directive versus participative leadership, with directive leaders commanding their subordinates and participative leaders inviting subordinates to participate in the decision-making process; bass & bass, 2008). although authoritarianism has been ne- glected by the research in recent decades, recent political events have provoked a renewed interest in the topic (harms et al., 2017).  authoritarianism, with its emphasis on coercion and control, maps well onto the concept of dominance. however, although many scholars treat dominance as synonymous with having an orientation toward power (or the desire for power; bass & bass, 2008), it is not clear whether this “desire for power” is truly a motivation for power (i.e., control over valued resources) or whether it is a motivation for a po- sition of high social rank more broadly. this distinction is important from the perspective of dual-strategies theory because the theory sug- gests that prestige-oriented leaders might be just as motivated as dominant individuals are for a position of social rank, but they may focus more on status hierarchies (whereas dominant individuals may be more focused on power; maner & case, 2016). thus, it is unclear how prestige-oriented leaders who strongly desire high status might fit into this framework.  while prestige-oriented leaders tend to be more democratic in their leadership style (maner, 2017; maner & case, 2016), a prestige strategy is not synonymous with democratic leadership. for one, competence is an important facet of a prestige-based approach, but it is not a key factor in the democratic leadership style. furthermore, democratic leadership tends to be a description of how a leader behaves or a group interacts, whereas prestige provides an additional element: the leader\\'s motivation when engaging in power sharing (the personal desire for status). finally, democratic leadership generally refers to a leadership style employed after being put into a position of high social rank (rather than a strategy for attaining or maintaining social rank).  the unique focus of dual-strategies theory  although the dual-strategies theory of social rank touches on many of the same themes of leadership research (as detailed above), its evolutionary origins and focus on social rank give it a unique focus relative to most leadership research. dual-strategies theory is unique in that it was devised by thinking about small, cohesive, constantly shifting groups that humans populated during the time of our evolu- tionary history (boehm, 1999; van vugt et al., 2008), as opposed to the typical formal organizational context where many leadership theories  k.j. mcclanahan the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101315  7    of the 20th and 21st century were conceived (von rueden & van vugt, 2015). this evolutionary background alone does not provide sufficient justification for the use of the theory. however, i argue that focusing on these small, informal hierarchies has given dual-strategies theory a unique and much needed perspective on leadership that would benefit the larger body of research on leadership. this new perspective is not intended to replace other leadership theories, but rather can add to their contribution to our understanding of leaders and followers in organizations. below, i outline a few ways in which dual-strategies theory of social rank represents a departure from most research on leadership and describe why its unique foci make it particularly well- equipped to explain today\\'s modern organizations and workforce. specifically, i highlight how dual-strategies theory\\'s emphasis on shifting power dynamics, its focus on informal hierarchies, and the introduction of prestige as a counterpoint to dominance is relevant to today\\'s economy (yet are underrepresented in major leadership theory).  emphasis on acquiring social rank and shifts in power  much of the organizational behavior research on leadership focuses on a leader-follower relationship that is already in place. while research on leadership emergence is certainly still present (see acton, foti, lord, & gladfelter, 2019; ensari, riggio, christian, & carslaw, 2011; and lakey et al., 2002 for reviews), it is somewhat removed from work examining formal leadership (zhang et al., 2012; see dinh et al., 2014 as a noteable excpetion). furthermore, the research on leadership emergence has largely lacked theoretical underpinnings (again, acton et al., 2019 and wellman, 2017 represent notable exceptions), while leadership theory has primarily focused situations in which the leader has already attained their position of leadership (bass & bass, 2008).  similarly, the majority of research in the field of organizational behavior on leadership assumes hierarchies to be rather static. the focus is on how leaders and followers each enact their roles, but there is not a lot of emphasis on how these roles might change or how the power dynamics might shift within a group. in short, most of the work on leadership acknowledges the power asymmetry between leader and follower, but beyond this, ignores any power dynamics in work groups and organizations.  in contrast, dual-strategies research has investigated both the ac- quisition of social rank and leadership behaviors in established hier- archies (e.g., case & maner, 2014; cheng et al., 2013; maner & mead, 2010), and the theory itself provides a conceptual framework to explain both phenomena. it also focuses on how instabilities within the hier- archy can impact a leader\\'s goals (case & maner, 2014). integrating dual-strategies theory into leadership research might help reinvigorate an interest in the leadership emergence in more traditional leadership theory and provide a way of bringing the two bodies of literature to- gether. furthermore, dual-strategies theory assumes a world in which no leadership position is immutable and hierarchies are constantly changing, so the emphasis is on how people take advantage of or pro- tect against power shifts.  this focus on shifting hierarchies and the acquisition of social rank is important given demographic trends in employment. specifically, younger employees are far less likely to stay with the same company for their entire career than workers just a generation ago (bureau of labor statistics, 2018). this means that in the future, the workforce is likely to be increasingly composed of employees who move from organization to organization more frequently than in the past (harris, 2014). this increased mobility means that people are regularly entering and navi- gating new work groups and hierarchies, making the acquisition of social rank a crucially important factor in organizations. furthermore, the decreased tenure of employees inherently makes hierarchies less stable—as employees leave, hierarchies need to be restructured to fill these gaps or accommodate external hires.  beyond employees choosing to move organizations more frequently, there is more of a demand for temporary workers: short-term and  contract work is representing an increasing proportion of work in the united states (horowitz, 2015). in this so-called “gig economy” (ashford, caza, & reid, 2018; petriglieri, ashford, & wrzesniewski, 2018a), the constant flow of workers in and out of organizations (or with varied clients) is likely to contribute to constantly changing hierarchies.  thus, the typical organizational hierarchies are likely less stable than they were when many of the classic leadership theories emerged, and theory that is able to explain and predict these power and status changes will be a boon to leadership researchers. furthermore, this focus on how hierarchies develop and change over time answers calls to make leadership research more focused on process and changing dy- namics (acton, foti, lord, & gladfelter, 2018; avolio et al., 2009; bendersky & pai, 2018; castillo & trinh, 2018).  emphasis on informal hierarchy  with the exception of the work on leadership emergence, the vast majority of the research on leadership in organizational behavior ex- amines formal hierarchies (i.e., formal supervisors in an organization). there is certainly an acknowledgement that one does not need to have formal leadership position to demonstrate leadership, but most of the empirical work has focused on the formal organizational context (northouse, 2018).  in contrast, in the small groups of our evolutionary past, there was no such thing as formal hierarchy dictated by a larger organization. indeed, the vast majority of human history likely took place in rela- tively egalitarian contexts that lacked formal hierarchy (kelly, 2007). for this reason, there remains in dual-strategies theory an emphasis on informal hierarchies (despite the fact that dominance and prestige are tactics that could be employed by both formal managers and informal leaders). while formal hierarchies still play a huge role in today\\'s or- ganizations, there are a few reasons to believe that informal hierarchies are increasingly of particular importance to organizations.  first, there is an increasing segment of the population that is opting out of employment in a traditional organization in favor of freelance work (an estimated 150 million workers in north america and western europe, many of whom are top knowledge workers, have already made this choice; petriglieri, ashford, & wrzesniewski, 2018b). for these workers, formal organizational hierarchy may not be particularly re- levant—rather than worrying about their interactions with their boss or their chances of getting promoted, they instead are focused on their performance in the eyes of their clientele and the way that they stack up relative to other freelance workers in their field. this employment reality, faced by an increasing number of workers, would likely be considered outside the wheelhouse of most traditional leadership the- ories. however, dual-strategy theory\\'s emphasis on informal hierarchies makes it well-equipped to explain how leadership and hierarchy are relevant for gig and freelance workers.  second, there is some evidence that egalitarianism is increasingly promoted as a management strategy (levering, 2016; marschan, welch, & welch, 1996): self-managing teams are increasingly common (kirkman, 2001); knowledge work—which is inherently less suited to authority and hierarchy (adler, 1999)—is representing an increasingly proportion of work (karoly & panis, 2004); and the majority of firms now use agile project management, which emphasizes collaborative workflows in which egalitarianism is valued (project management institute, 2017). while there is likely a great deal of variation in the degree to which organizations actually adopt egalitarian ideals, de- centralization of decision-making power appears to be increasingly common even among large, multi-national corporations (marschan et al., 1996). because humans appear to have natural tendencies toward hierarchy of some kind (van berkel, crandall, eidelman, & blanchar, 2015), a decreasing reliance on formal hierarchies is likely result in increasingly important status and informal hierarchies (marschan et al., 1996; tiedens, unzueta, & young, 2007), a focus for dual-strategies  k.j. mcclanahan the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101315  8    theory. furthermore, if egalitarianism is widely valued, group members are likely to punish “upstarts” who try to claim power through force (boehm, 1999). understanding how potential leaders can obtain in- fluence in such contexts is therefore key to understanding influence in today\\'s organizations. dual-strategies theory articulates a strategy (prestige) that fits these parameters.  third, it is becoming more readily apparent that even organizations with steep, formal hierarchies are shaped by the informal hierarchies of their employees. for example, there is evidence that group performance appears to be determined in part by the informal hierarchies among group members (bendersky & hays, 2017; joshi & knight, 2014; zhang et al., 2012). additionally, one\\'s informal social landscape can impact promotion in the formal organization hierarchy (podolny & baron, 1997). thus, even in traditionally hierarchical firms, dual-strategy theory\\'s emphasis on informal hierarchies is worth considering.  prestige as a counterpart to dominance  one of the major contributions of the dual-strategies theory of social rank is the introduction of the prestige strategy as a counterpart to dominance. as noted above, dominance—or similar variants such as authoritarianism, autocratic, or directive leadership—have long been a subject of leadership research. many of these theories have described alterative leadership strategies that do not use force or coercion (e.g., democratic leadership, servant leadership, transformational leader- ship). however, prestige differs from these strategies in a few key ways. first, as articulated earlier, demonstrating competence is a key element to a prestige strategy. second, a prestige-oriented strategy may not inherently be prosocial: while prestige-oriented leaders act in extremely prosocial ways, their own personal desire for status is thought to un- derlie much of their group-oriented behavior. this represents a unique combination of traits, strategies, and motives that has not been re- flected in the leadership literature up to this point.  there are several reasons why investigating prestige makes sense in the modern work context. first, with the dawn of the information age, having unique, complicated skillsets and competencies is increasingly important for employees (stewart, 1998). in the past, when employees were more likely to be in menial or non-technical jobs, seniority or tenure were much larger factors in determining promotion (rosenfeld, 2014). however, in today\\'s knowledge economy (adler, 1999), em- ployee knowledge and skills are more important than ever, bringing competence to the forefront of decisions as to who will attain positions at the top of the hierarchy. prestige\\'s focus on demonstrating skills as a basis for deference is particularly relevant in this employment climate.  additionally, as mentioned above, organizations are increasingly characterized by informal and shifting hierarchies. interestingly, these hierarchies often lead to more social-rank related conflicts (hays & bendersky, 2015), and may make status a more valued commodity. because prestige is thought to reflect a desire for status, it may be a particularly informative construct to investigate in this modern context.  how leadership research can enhance dual-strategies theory  just as introducing the dual-strategies theory of social rank into the broader leadership research can provide unique insights into the study of leadership in organizations, insights from the rich body of leadership theory and research can increase the viability and veracity of the dual- strategies theory of social rank. below, i describe three ways in which leadership theory and research can (and should) be integrated into the work dual-strategies theory in order to provide a more robust field of inquiry. specifically, i describe how an increased focused on the group, the impact of contextual factors on the effectiveness of dominance and prestige, and more consideration of organizational factors such as formal hierarchy, diversity, and technology are important areas in which to expand this are of research.  stronger focus on the group  a central focus of leadership research has been the leader\\'s impact on the group. indeed, leadership research continues to shift from a focus on leadership traits to a process and group focus (avolio et al., 2009). dual-strategies theory, on the other hand, has largely focused on the psychology of the leader, with relatively few studies looking at the experience of the group or the effectiveness of the group. it should be noted that this reflects a disconnect between theory and actual re- search—while dual-strategies theory has a heavy focus on the actual group context, the empirical research on dual-strategies theory has maintained a rather consistent focus on the individual employing the strategy. for example, up to this point, “effectiveness” from a dual- strategies perspective has referred to whether the leader is able to attain a position of social rank, not whether the group is successful in ac- complishing their goals (see, for example, cheng et al., 2013). the ef- fects of each of these strategies on group performance is likely to be one of the primary questions with which organizations and practitioners are concerned, so this certainly represents an important area for future research.  there has also been very little research that considers the perspec- tive of the followers, an area of research that is experiencing a revival in organizational behavior research (avolio et al., 2009; bastardoz & van vugt, 2019; robert g lord et al., 2017; van vugt et al., 2008). the extant literature suggests that other group members tend to dislike dominant individuals (cheng et al., 2013; redhead, o\\'gorman, cheng, driver, & foulsham, 2019), except in instances such as economic un- certainty or intergroup conflict (kakkar & sivanathan, 2017; laustsen & petersen, 2017; van vugt & grabo, 2015), but beyond this, dual-stra- tegies theory cannot speak to how followers perceive dominant or prestige-oriented leaders.  there is likely a high degree of individual variation in how a sub- ordinate may respond to dominant or prestige-based leader. research from lmx suggests that leaders have distinct relationships with each of their followers, and that the quality of the leader-follower relationship is a function of both the leader and the follower (gerstner & day, 1997). yet, leader-follower fit has not been discussed in the work on dom- inance and prestige, despite conjectures that follower traits are likely an important factor in understanding how controlling leaders in particular attain positions of influence (harms et al., 2017).  beyond follower\\'s perceptions of or desire for dominant and pres- tige-oriented leadership, it is also worth considering how fellow group members influence whether an individual employs a dominance or prestige-based strategy. leadership theory suggests that the effective- ness of a leadership style is impacted by the traits of the followers (bass, 1960), and it is easy to imagine that leaders would shift their strategies depending on the qualities and behavior of group members. a further discussion of dominance and prestige as strategies that include input from group members would be a boon to this area of research.  an investigation of context  researchers as early as the 1940s have suggested that it is fruitless to study the effectiveness of any given leadership strategy without in- formation about context (stogdill, 1948). that is, a leadership strategy that might be wildly effective in a group of 14-year-old boys may not be efficacious in a team of research scientists. thus, it is widely accepted in general leadership research that the effectiveness of leadership traits or strategies are contingent on the situation (anderson, spataro, & flynn, 2008; bass, 1960; bass & bass, 2008; hersey, 1985; hersey, blanchard, & natemeyer, 1979; oc, 2018). however, to this point, dual-strategies theory has paid little attention to how contextual factors impact dom- inance and prestige as strategies. this represents a serious limitation to this area of research and also a great opportunity for further work.  there has been some discussion of contextual factors that impact the behavior of dominant or prestige-oriented leaders, including intergroup  k.j. mcclanahan the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101315  9    competition, stability of the hierarchy, and the anonymity of decision making (case & maner, 2014; maner & mead, 2010). however, research on how contextual factors impact on the effectiveness of dominance and prestige as strategies for attaining social rank and leading groups has been minimal. thus far, research has indicated that the viability of dominance as a strategy increases with economic instability, group status threat, and intergroup conflict (fortunato & gavrilets, 2014; kakkar & sivanathan, 2017; laustsen & petersen, 2017; van vugt & grabo, 2015). there is also some evidence that dominance might be more effective in short-term contexts (mcclanahan, cheng, carswell, & craig, 2019; redhead et al., 2019), in situations where it is challenging for group members to revolt (ronay et al., 2019), or in situations where a leader is expected to punish free-riders (lukaszewski et al., 2016; von rueden, 2014). there has been some theorizing that prestige might be a better strategy for prompting creativity, while dominance might be better effective for tasks requiring coordination (maner, 2016), but this lacks empirical evidence. indeed, others argue that prestige-based lea- ders might possess superior coordination abilities due to their increased knowledge and presumed ability to intelligently solve complex tasks (hagen & garfield, 2019). in short, our empirical understanding of how the effectiveness of dominance and prestige varies from situation to situation is extremely limited.  the lack of attention to context is a surprising oversight in dual- strategies theory, as it is hard to imagine that the efficacy of these strategies would not vary widely depending on the nature and purpose of the group or the broader organization. for example, the effectiveness of dominance or prestige is likely to be impacted by components of the group task such as domain, degree of interdependence required, time pressure, and performance pressure. expectations of the leader\\'s role are also worth considering: is the leader\\'s primary responsibility co- ordinating tasks? motivating subordinates? mentoring them? advocating for the group? these distinct purposes are likely to impact the type of leader desired. finally, broader contextual factors such as group size, the formality and complexity of the organizational struc- ture, organizational culture, and even firm performance are likely to impact who is promoted and which leaders are deemed successful, ul- timately shaping whether a dominance or prestige strategy is effective. in short, there are likely dozens of contextual factors that impact the effectiveness of dominance and prestige (see oc, 2018 for a compre- hensive overview of important contextual factors in organizationals). a serious examination of these factors is an important next step for the application of dual-strategies theory to modern organizations.  more attention to modern organizational facets  while the focus on informal authority, small groups, and shifting hierarchies is likely to shed important insights into modern organiza- tions (as outlined above), there are some facets of modern organizations that dual-strategies theory has not yet explicitly addressed. in parti- cular, dual-strategies theory could provide a more complete portrait for dominance and prestige in modern organizations with more explicit consideration of factors such as a) formal hierarchy, b) demographic diversity, and c) technology.  first, despite the argument above that many of today\\'s employees work in increasingly egalitarian contexts, many people still work in large, bureaucratic organizations. dual-strategies theory was initially devised to describe contexts in which positions of social rank were determined solely by an individual\\'s ability to garner followers, not on his/her ability to navigate preexisting institutional hierarchies (henrich et al., 2015). indeed, much of the empirical research on dual-strategies theory has focused on this context. additionally, much research on leadership emergence broadly and dual-strategies theory specifically assumes that fellow group members elect a leader. however, the reality of most organizations is that a leader is put into place by people above them in the organization (or by an external hiring group). how might leadership selection vary when the person selecting the leader will not  be his/her subordinate? to my knowledge, this question remains un- answered.  another area for advancement involves issues of race, gender, and diversity, which are dramatically different in a modern organization than they were in the small-scale societies of our evolutionary past. for example, in small-scale societies thought to characterize the eea, groups typically did not have mixed-gender hierarchies (not to say that women did not have leadership roles, but rather that these leadership roles tended to be in different domains than men; garfield et al., 2019). similarly, it was uncommon for these groups to have contact with groups of other races (cosmides, tooby, & kurzban, 2003). it is therefore unsurprising that dual-strategies theory does not explicitly theorize about how these strategies interact with gender or race in organizations. however, gender and race relations in the workplace are important and salient hierarchies in organizations (carli & eagly, 2001; sidanius & pratto, 1999) and these hierarchies are likely navigated using dominance or prestige-based strategies (maner & case, 2016). beyond this, however, gender and racial hierarchies are complicated, nuanced, and distinct from other hierarchies. for example, there is evidence that dominance is perceived differently based on the leader\\'s gender (williams & tiedens, 2016), race (livingston & pearce, 2010), sexual orientation (wilson, remedios, & rule, 2017), or inter- sectionality (livingston, rosette, & washington, 2012). thus, research on how demographic characteristics such as race, gender, sexual or- ientation, as well as the intersection of these factors, is likely to provide important insights beyond the purview of dual-strategies theory.  in a similar vein, the pervasiveness of modern technology can dra- matically change the dynamics of a work group—for example, how might dominance and/or prestige manifest themselves in work groups that primarily work remotely? dual-strategies theory was developed with the assumption that groups were co-located and communicated face-to-face. given that much of today\\'s work does not follow this pattern, considering how and when technology impacts these strategies may be an important next step in the application of dual-strategies theory to the modern workplace.  conclusion  while most leadership theories were developed by looking at the large, stagnant, and bureaucratic organizations of the 20th century, the dual-strategies theory of social rank focuses on the informal leader- follower dynamics that characterize most of human history (garfield et al., 2019). because of its evolutionary origins, the dual-strategies theory of social rank provides a unique perspective on leadership that is also surprisingly well-equipped for application to modern workplace environments. the aim of this review was to provide a guide to un- derstanding dual-strategies theory in the context of leadership theory and research and to demonstrate the efficacy of dual-strategies theory in answering important questions about leadership and hierarchy in modern organizations. one main conclusion of this review is that future research that integrates ideas from broader leadership theory into dual- strategies theory (and/or that explores dual-strategies theory in the organizational context more explicitly) is likely to improve dual-stra- tegies theory and provide unique insight into today\\'s evolving organi- zations.  acknowledgement  the author would like to thank jon k. maner, charleen r. case, nour s. kteily and anonymous reviewers for their extremely valuable feedback, all of which was instrumental in shaping this manuscript. she would also like to thank loran f. nordgren for encouraging her to develop these ideas and this manuscript.  k.j. mcclanahan the leadership quarterly 31 (2020) 101315  10    references  acton, b. p., foti, r. j., lord, r. g., & gladfelter, j. a.

dyadic relationships  a b s t r a c t  despite its importance in multilevel research  the dyad level of analysis has been known as the most poorly understood level  suggestions have been made recently in terms of levels alignment issues and methodologies to enhance the understanding of dyadic phenomena  given recent remedies for dyads research and that the leader  follower dyad is generally considered the key dyad in organizations  we conducted a comprehensive review of the current state of leader follower dyads research to assess what we know and how much we know about leader follower dyads research conducted at the dyad level  specifically  we summarized empirical studies that focused on leader follower dyads that used data collected on the same variables from both dyadic partners  this review involved coding studies of these  pure  leader follower dyads based on several dyadic theories   and multiple analytic methods   that dealt with leader  follower dyads directly  based on the results  this review generated a nomological network of constructs for understanding leader follower dyads and to provide suggestions for future leader follower dyads research   introduction  the leader follower dyad  a unit composed of one leader and one follower who are interdependent  is generally identified as the key dyad among multiple types of dyads in organizations   and has been the focus of numerous leadership studies    however  of the four levels of analysis in a typical levels framework    the dyad level is known as the most poorly understood level   and has often been ignored in mul  tilevel research     the major reason contributing to the lack of understanding of the dyad level is levels of analysis misalignment issues  in particular  there is an emerging consensus among organizational behavior and leader  ship scholars that when pure dyadic phenomenon is focal  it may be misleading to theorize and hypothesize at the dyad level but measure or  assess the phenomenon from only one side of the dyadic partnership      pure dyadic phenomena reside conceptually and operate empirically at the dyad level   and can include notions such as dyad characteristics    emergent properties   shared within the dyad  quality of those emergent properties as assessed by both members  and  agreement between the dyadic partners  since dyad level phenomena are mostly emergent from the interaction between the two individuals      measuring a variable of interest from solely one dyadic partner would lead to an incomplete view of the phenomenon of interest and may result in a misrepresentation of the dyadic relationship     in other words  when understanding the   reality of the dyadic relationship is of interest  rather than one person s perception of the relationship  taking a dual perspective   will    received   november    received in revised form   july    accepted   july    ⁎ corresponding author  e mail addresses

of the focal dyadic phenomenon  measuring a variable of interest only from one dyadic member s per  spective assumes that this focal person s view represents two possibly different views and ignores the other member s viewpoint  omitting one member s perspective is potentially problematic as one person s per  ception may not be enough to represent two parties  perceptions of the shared dyadic experience  and two people s views toward an identical object can be either similar or different    the general idea of con  sidering all participating parties in the phenomenon of interest is therefore critical from a validity standpoint  it is interesting to note that this approach is regularly used in group  and team level studies  where data are frequently collected from all group and team members  in a similar approach  when interested in pure dyadic phenomenon  re  searchers could take both dyadic partners  view into account and collect data from all   dyad members     as these levels of analysis misalignment issues for the dyad level are becoming more understood and interest in applying potential remedies have increased    we believe it is timely to review the cur  rent state of the science of leader follower dyads research  our focus in this review is to take stock of what we know and how much we know about pure leader follower dyadic phenomena  in doing so  we generate a nomological network for leader follower dyads research to represent current empirical findings and highlight research areas that require further attention  we limit this review to  pure  leader follower dyadic studies   that align the levels of theory  measurement  analysis  and inference at the dyad level  such studies theorize a dyad level phenomenon  agreement in dyads   assess at least one variable about the leader  follower  or relationship from both dyadic partners  per  spectives  and generate dyad level variables by matching both dyadic partners  responses  as our focus is on the pure dyad level  we will not be reviewing studies that mainly examined the correlates  causes  or effects of individual level perceptions of the relationship   perception      our work differs from previous reviews that incorporated leader  follower dyadic theories   in that we have a specific focus on a single level of analysis   and yet a broader focus in terms of theories  as we are not limiting our review to lmx  one of the most studied theories on leader follower relationship  contrary to yammarino et al    s comprehensive review on leadership and levels of analysis that incorporated various leadership theories and pinpointed levels of analysis misalignment issues  we particularly focus on studies of dyad level theories and summarize the current state of leader follower dyads research  moreover  beyond dionne et al    s more up to date review that examined levels of analysis in  corporation in both conceptual and empirical leadership research published only in the leadership quarterly  this review focuses explicitly on dyad level leadership studies published in several top organizational behavior and management journals and aims to summarize leader fol  lower dyads research in terms of theories  methods  variables  and variable dimensions   in addition  our review differs from the extant reviews on leader  follower dyads that focus on levels based issues only within lmx re  search    only with regard to methodological issues in dyads research    only on lmx agreement    or only on the state of affect and lmx research from a multilevel perspective    rather  our focus is to review pure dyad level studies in terms of the usage of theories  methods  and variables in a broader scope  in terms of theories and variables  our  scope includes but is not limited to dyad level lmx   and or lmx agreement    with respect to pure dyadic level investigations  we also consider vertical dyad linkage    individualized leadership    lmx  relational leadership theory    and leader follower congruence    with regard to methods  we are not focusing on raising methodological concerns but rather concentrating on understanding how each dyadic research method proposed and re  viewed elsewhere     such as multilevel modeling  polynomial regression  within and between analysis    and actor partner inter  dependence model   one with many model     has been utilized in leader follower dyads studies  finally  this review is distinct from liden et al    s theoretical conceptual review  which centers on the development and nature of dyadic relationships  as we review empirical leader follower dyads studies and concentrate on the vari  ables used in those studies to generate a nomological network for leader follower dyads research   in summary  we extend the findings from the aforementioned re  views  first  by capturing studies on leader follower dyads published in multiple journal outlets  second  by including dyadic relationship based studies not limited to only lmx theory  third  by reviewing studies that include variables of focus assessed from both dyadic partners  and fourth  by developing a nomological network relevant for leader fol  lower dyads theory building and testing   in the following sections  to help frame our review  we provide an overview of current theories on leader follower dyads  suggested re  search methods for examining dyadic phenomena  and levels and di  mensionality issues regarding leader follower dyads  to explore how specific theories and methods have been utilized to examine dyadic phenomenon  we develop targeted research questions to be addressed via comprehensive review results derived from coding pure leader fol  lower dyads studies  ultimately  we generate a nomological network derived from key variables within existing dyad studies and present the connection among these variables to summarize the current state of leader follower dyads research  based on review results and the pro  posed nomological network  we suggest future directions for leader  follower dyads research   overview and research questions  theories of leader follower dyads  we initially employed five theories   on leader follower dyads or leader follower relationships identified in a previous review by dionne et al    as the framework to categorize leader follower dyads studies in our review  these five theories re  present leadership generally proposed as pure leader follower dyadic relations of interest   vertical dyad linkage   vdl challenged the assumptions of the traditional leadership ap   proach   and explained the me  chanism of differentiated relationship development by introducing the concept of  negotiating latitude     specifically  depending on the degree of the negotiating latitude within dyads  the dyadic relationship between supervisor and subordinate can be either supervision   or leadership      as vdl addressed a separation of in groups and out groups within an existing group  the level of analysis for vdl was suggested as dyads within group     empirical support for vdl showed mixed results  vdl was  j  kim  et al  the leadership quarterly             supported with superior manager dyads in a public university setting    but with different samples   and different measures of negotiating latitude and analytical methods    the results were inconsistent with the early studies  the con  flicting results raised questions about the validity of the negotiating latitude measure and the level of analysis of vdl   despite these questions  vdl made a significant contribution to the field by challenging the assumption of als regarding leader follower relationships and suggesting such relationships are often differentiated in a group context  this was a new perspective on leader follower re  lationships that placed the  dyad  as a central unit of analysis for lea  dership research  as a result  vdl became the foundation of other leader follower dyadic relationships theories   individualized leadership knowing that leaders form differentiated relationships with fol   lowers  dansereau et al    provided empirical support for the level of the leader follower relationship such that perceptions of investments and returns in the relationship were similar between the leader and follower and this pattern was replicated across all dyads with only the degree of investments and returns varying  the notion that a leader and a follower share similar perceptions but the degree of perceptions differ from dyad to dyad was further developed as individualized leadership theory    individualized leadership focuses on the reciprocity   process that makes two individuals   become   a dyad  specifically  the iterative process of exchanging support for self worth and satisfying performance between leader and follower helps the relationship be  tween the dyadic partners to become unique and independent from other dyads and the group  and fosters the interdependence within the dyad     individualized leadership has received empirical support from both quantitative and qualitative studies such that support for self worth and satisfying performance   showed similarity within the dyads and differences across the dyads    in other words  dyads were char  acterized as independent from other dyads and the group yet having interdependence between dyadic partners in those studies   individualized leadership was not suggested as an alternative to als or vdl  but rather as an additional perspective on leadership by iden  tifying a relatively new relational process    and suggesting two variables   and their association that operate at the dyad level    although individualized leadership re  ceived empirical support  some questions on contextual factors   have been raised  resulting in calls for additional research to resolve issues and provide greater clarity to dyadic leadership concepts     leader member exchange   lmx   kept the  central notion of vdl   that leaders develop differentiated relationships that form in groups out groups   but put more emphasis on the quality of the exchange relationship that a leader maintains with followers  a low quality relationship was characterized as being transactional  which is close to economic exchange  whereas a high quality relation  ship was characterized as having high trust  mutual liking  and respect  which represents social exchange    after exploring the existence of differentiated re  lationships depending on the relationship qualities  lmx has evolved to reflect a cycle of leader follower relationship development     after further development of lmx theory    bernerth et al    introduced an additional perspective and measure   that concentrated on the  social exchange  nature of the leader follower exchange relationships  in other words  this additional view shifted the focus of lmx from the quality of the relationship   to the quality of the   exchange behavior in the relationship  colquitt  baer  long  and halvorsen ganepola   provided initial evidence that lmsx captures the social exchange nature of the leader  follower relationship better than other relationship related measures  including lmx    by examining the face validity of the measures from undergraduate   students  viewpoint   and suggested that lmsx might be more appropriate to use when studying lmx and the social exchange in relationships   while lmsx has refocused exploration on the quality of the social exchange and related behaviors  some issues remain surrounding the concept of lmx such that the level of lmx theory is unclear  although lmx was introduced conceptually as a dyad level theory  the majority of lmx studies have been conducted at the individual level    followers  perception of lmx quality was mostly measured at the individual level and has been shown to be both an important predictor of an individual s cognitive  affective  and behavioral outcomes and a mediating me  chanism that connects individual or interpersonal relationship char  acteristics and those individual outcomes    measuring lmx at the individual level can be helpful when examining the cause and effect   of an individual s relationship perceptions but may be pro  blematic when used to represent the dyadic relationship  as one in  dividual s relationship perception may not be an accurate representa  tion of the relationship    when an individual s lmx quality perception is used as a proxy for dyadic lmx quality  and inferences are made for a dyadic phenomenon  theoretical contribution for understanding leader fol  lower dyads may be limited   several researchers investigated the level at which lmx operates and showed that  when properly measured and analyzed with both dyadic partners  perspectives  lmx can be a dyadic phenomenon    although the number of pure dyad level lmx studies   is far less than individual level lmx studies    dyad level lmx studies are increasing recently with better measurement and analysis practices   relational leadership relational leadership theory     highlights the importance of the relational process that enables leadership and considers leadership as a socially constructed phenomenon    moreover  the relationship is considered as an outcome that is produced through the relational process      in other words  rlt is a theory that emphasizes relational dy  namics as an organizing mechanism and views the relationship as an outcome   as the major focus of rlt is on understanding the process of re  lationship development  qualitative research methods   have been suggested as a suitable in  vestigative approach    rlt has been further advanced through applying diverse disciplinary perspectives and contexts   and mixed methods   to capture  for example  the relational dynamics in  j  kim  et al  the leadership quarterly             leader follower dyadic communication patterns  the focal relationship in rlt  however  is not limited to leader   follower relationship but includes all possible forms of relationships within organizations    in terms of levels  rlt involves dyads  but goes beyond and includes groups and collectives  although rlt does not directly or solely focus on dyadic phenomenon  the the  ory s relational process orientation can be used as a framework to un  derstand dyadic relationship development and procedural antecedents of relational outcomes  in particular  rlt provides insight to investigate issues such as the factors affecting relationship development  the as  sociations among factors to build an emerging dyadic relationship  and patterns of social interactions in the relationships   leader follower congruence congruence involves matching two conceptually distinct constructs  and can be presented with different terms such as fit  similarity  match  or agreement    leader follower congruence is one type of person environment fit  considering the leader as the environment for the follower and vice versa    depending on the measure  congruence can be categorized into subjective   and objective   congruence    while subjective congruence considers an individual s   belief about whether he she fits well with the en  vironment    objective congruence involves explicit com  parison of the follower s and the leader s characteristics or perceptions  measured from both independently    needs supplies fit and demands abilities fit   have also been considered at the dyad level to predict followers  individual outcomes     leader follower congruence has gained empirical support in pre  dicting various individual outcomes  kristof brown et al    s meta  analysis showed that leader follower fit    including both subjective and objective fit  is positively related to in  dividual outcomes such as job satisfaction  supervisor satisfaction  and lmx  additionally  relational demography    which considers the similarity and dissimilarity of demographic char  acteristics    was pre  sented as a dyad level variable that predicts individual outcomes  the association between  similarity in individual characteristics in dyads and individual outcomes provides an understanding of how in  dividuals are influenced by having a better worse matched partner  this research framework can be extended by employing dyad level outcomes and provide an additional understanding of leader follower dyadic relationships   summary leader follower dyadic phenomena have been viewed from diverse  theoretical perspectives that fall into the general domain of leadership or leader follower relationships  each theory views the dyadic phe  nomena from different levels of analysis perspectives and captures the dyadic phenomena differently by focusing on either process or out  comes  individualized leadership emphasizes the investment return cycle as a key process to build interdependence in the dyad  whereas rlt focuses on the dynamic nature of the relationship development process  on the other hand  lmx concentrates on high quality re  lationship outcomes  and leader follower congruence considers the outcomes of  match between two individuals  characteristics  given the different foci  each theory provides a foundation for different re  search questions on leader follower dyadic phenomena  moreover  it is possible that theories other than these five theories could have been used to examine different aspects of leader follower dyads   to understand how much the dyad  and or relationship related theories in leadership have been employed and what other theories have been used in leader follower dyads studies since the beginning of dyads studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of  leader follower dyads research and identify theories that have been  utilized in leader follower dyads studies  we propose the fol  lowing research question on the usage of each theory in leader follower dyads research   research question     what is the current usage of dyad the  ories to explain the leader follower dyadic phenomenon  which theories are used  to what degree  and how are they formulated to account for pure dyadic phenomenon   dyadic research methods  analyzing dyadic data with appropriate dyadic research methods and techniques requires specification of the type of dyads involved    for example  failure to include group membership as a group  level variable when dyads are embedded in groups could result in in  accurate examination of dyadic phenomena  specifically  dyadic data can be collected from either independent dyads   or dependent dyads      as the importance of con  sidering data dependencies in dyadic analyses has been emphasized in previous research    we examine whether the type of dyads has been considered in the leader follower dyads research by addressing research question below   research question  a    do leader follower dyad studies focus on independent or dependent dyads and how is the focus typically justified   several specific methods have been suggested for testing theoretical notions about leader follower dyads and analyzing data collected from both dyadic partners    the usage of these available methods depends on the research questions  and certain questions may require the use of more than one of these primary methods summarized below   multilevel modeling when a research question involves contemporary cross level effects      such as a direct relationship between a higher level independent variable and a lower level dependent vari  able  or a moderating effect of a higher level independent variable on a lower level independent dependent variable relationship   multilevel   modeling can be implemented through several software platforms    r  stata  and mplus   when implementing a dyad level variable as an in  dependent variable  both dyadic partners  individual responses need to be included and aggregated     multilevel modeling can specify the types of dyads that enable re  searchers to study both independent and dependent dyads in organi  zations  in addition  multilevel modeling can address research questions involving   cross level interactions by including higher  level moderators in the model  another strength of multilevel modeling comes from having an individual level dependent variable  this allows for the examination of research questions pertaining to the effect of dyad level predictors on individual outcomes  when the phenomenon of interest is a   cross level relationship  then multilevel modeling is a suitable method to use  however  when the phenomenon of interest involves a higher level   dependent variable  multilevel modeling might not be applicable   polynomial regression polynomial regression and response surface methodology   have been introduced as alternatives to difference scores when ex  amining the effect of similarity  congruence  fit  and or the match be  tween two entities or notions  as a dyad involves two individuals  polynomial regression could be a suitable method for studying the  j  kim  et al  the leadership quarterly             effects of convergence and divergence of two individuals  perceptions   or the effects of similarity and dissimilarity of two individuals  characteristics on individual outcomes    after fitting the polynomial regression model  regression coefficients  covariances  and standard errors are used to estimate the response surface which visually shows the effects of convergence and divergence    by examining the slope and curva  ture of the congruence and incongruence lines of the estimated re  sponse surface  research questions on the similarity  congruence  fit  or match can be investigated  in addition  nonindependence of dyads can be considered by employing cross level polynomial regression     although polynomial regression is a useful tool to study the effect of congruence and or divergence of the predictor on individual outcomes  this method cannot be directly implemented when examining dyad  level outcomes  the additional step of aggregating the two individuals  outcomes to generate a dyad level variable is necessary to study dyadic phenomenon   within and between analysis   waba is useful for testing the level of analysis of variables    the relationship between the variables    and traditional cross level effects    contrary to other dyadic data analysis methods that allow dependent variables to only be at the individual level  waba can be used when the dependent variable is a dyad level variable  waba uses anova and correlation based procedures to make inferences about the level  of variables and relationships between the variables and whether there are traditional cross level effects     waba is a tool to test the theoretically driven level of variables and relationships of interest  the strength of waba is that it can consider different types of dyads    test multi level effects    and employ dyad level outcomes in the model  waba can be challenging when the phenomenon of interest is complex  involving multiple mediators and moderators simultaneously in analyses    but advanced waba procedures can be employed to overcome this limitation     actor partner interdependence model   one with many   model  apim and owm models were initially suggested for dyadic analyses of interpersonal and romantic relationships    the use of each model depends on whether the dyads are in  dependent   or dependent      apim requires both independent and dependent variables to be collected from both dyadic partners and could address research questions on how each dyadic partners  char  acteristics influence himself herself and the dyadic partner   and can examine the relative strength of each effect    owm can be employed for dependent  dyads that involve multiple relationships of an individual  owm en  compasses the actor effect  partner effect  and relationship effect and allows researchers to examine whether the reciprocity between the actor and partner are generalized among or unique to dyads     apim owm  depending on the type of dyads being studied  can simultaneously investigate interpersonal and intrapersonal effects  the independent and dependent variables should both be matched data   from the dyad  when running the model  the independent variable and dependent variable are not aggregated to one value that represents the dyads  but each individual s response is used separately  apim owm can examine how a dyad member can impact his her relationship partner  but unique characteristics of the dyad or the effect of the combination of two in  dividuals  characteristics cannot be examined through this method   summary various methods that have different foci and involve different levels  of variables have been suggested for dyadic data analysis    based on the research questions or hypotheses  methods could be used alone  jointly  or sequentially     to understand how these four dyadic data analysis methods have been employed and explore what other methods have been used to study leader follower dyads  our review results will be summarized by focusing on the below research question   research question  b    what dyadic research methods have been used  and to what degree  in leader follower dyad studies  how are they formulated and used to account for pure dyads   antecedents and outcomes of leader follower dyads  studies on leader follower relationships have been scattered in terms of theoretical basis and levels of analysis    for instance  currently what is known about leader  follower exchange relationships is mainly based on individual level studies   such that several meta ana  lyses were conducted to show the antecedents  consequences  and correlates of individual level lmx perceptions    but dyad level lmx has received relatively little attention in the reviews which led to limited understanding of dyadic exchange relationships  in terms of dyad level studies  leader follower congruence studies were conducted at the dyad level and predicted the impact of dyad characteristics   on diverse individual outcomes    in  dividualized leadership studies were also conducted at the dyad level by examining the relationship between support for self worth and sa  tisfying performance  both measured at the dyad level     given the possibility of examining diverse levels of analysis in leader follower dyads studies  it would be beneficial to review and summarize the pure leader follower dyads studies  accordingly  we re  view studies that aligned the levels of theory  measurement  and ana  lysis at the dyad level   both dyad individual polynomial regression effect of leader follower congruence both dyad individual waba level of variable    level of relationship       cross level effects   both dyad

and analyzed with dyadic research methods  to understand the antecedents and consequences of pure leader follower dyadic phenomena   to capture the current state of leader follower dyads research  there is value in generating a nomological network   that integrates previous research findings  in particular  a no  mological network will show the unique characteristics of leader fol  lower dyads  and antecedents and consequences of those leader fol  lower dyads characteristics  as a result  the nomological network generated in this review will depict what we currently know about leader follower dyads  therefore  we propose the research question below   research question      what does the nomological network of leader follower dyads look like  what are the key antecedents and con  sequences for leader follower dyads  and are these dyadic level focused or individual differences focused precursors and consequences   in addition  the multidimensionality of leader follower dyadic phenomenon could be considered as different dimensions capturing different aspects characteristics of the dyad  cognition  affect  and behavior dimensions have been widely used when studying groups  teams    and these dimensions are ap  plicable to dyads as a dyad is a unique special form of a group  dyads can have shared perceptions  affective states  and behavioral patterns  meaning that outcomes of dyadic interaction can be categorized into these dimensions   for example  the lmx construct has been known to be multi  dimensional as different measures capture different aspects of the dyadic exchange relationship    lmx     appears to capture the cognitive aspect of a relationship by asking how the working relationship is perceived  lmx mdm   measures affect  loyalty  contribution  and professional respect that appear to be a mix of affective  cognitive  and behavioral aspects of the relationship  moreover  lmsx   focuses on the   exchanging behavior that takes place within the dyad  as such  for lmx and other dyadic phenomena  different mea  sures capturing different aspects of leader follower relationships raises the possibility of the multidimensional nature of dyadic phenomena  in addition  given that outcomes of leader follower relationships can be categorized as affect  behavior  or cognition    it would be worth examining the dimensions of the outcomes of dyads or dyadic relationships as well  therefore  we propose   research question      what is the dimensionality   of variables in leader follower dyads studies   literature review method  to explore the above research questions and conduct a compre  hensive review of leader follower dyads research  studies focusing on the leader follower dyads were identified through abstract keyword searches from web based databases    the search  as in prior studies  was constrained to high quality peer reviewed journals in management  applied psychology  and leadership published until august    from the clarivate analytics web of science   impact factor list    we filtered journals with impact factor      and sorted journals that publish empirical work on micro organizational behavior phenomena  journal search based on the im  pact factor yielded   journals  in addition to these   journals  we included two journals   in our review that have been in  cluded in previous reviews on leadership    a full list of journals and the number of articles included in the current review by journal is presented in table     keywords used in the search were based on leader follower dyad theories    for lmx  the keyword  dyad   was combined to specify the level because lmx has been theoretically suggested   and empirically tested at multiple levels and not limited to the dyad level    we conducted a search with broader keyword phrases  leader    dyad     superior    dyad     supervisor    dyad    and  manager    dyad   to search articles that focused on leader follower congruence  as different terms are used to represent congruence    and to capture articles that are based on theories other than five initial theories discussed above   as empirical studies on leader follower dyads are the focus of this review  only quantitative studies on leader follower dyads in workplace were included  specifically  for quantitative studies on leader follower dyads  only studies that measured at least one variable from both members of the dyad were included  conceptual work  qualitative studies  meta analyses  literature reviews  lab experiments  student samples studies  and scale development studies were excluded  as they did not fit our inclusion criteria to explore our research questions   initial keyword searches from the journals yielded   articles  inclusion criteria were applied to screen the initial searched articles  abstracts and method sections of all articles were examined to de  termine the final set of articles to be coded    after the screening    out of   articles were excluded  these   articles did not meet the inclusion criteria because they were either   conceptual      meta analysis litera  ture review      scale development construct validation      qualitative

or   empirical studies that focused on leader follower dyads and collected dyadic data but did not match dyadic data and used the data for se  parate individual level analyses only    thus    articles remained to be coded   coding process  coder training  four coders with doctoral level training in organizational behavior and leadership conducted the coding  all coders had knowledge about dyads and

levels of analysis framework  to ensure accurate coding  all coders received extensive training to familiarize themselves with the coding scheme and process  the training was conducted in two phases  in the first phase  coders coded ten articles individually and met to compare the results  if any discrepancies were found  coders discussed differences to reach an agreement and a consensus code  in the second practice session  four coders were split into two pairs  after individually coding another   articles  coders met their partner to discuss the coding results and reach an agreement  after discussing within each pair  all coders met to review results that were agreed upon within the pairs  from this discussion  coders were able to cross check the results between coding pairs  after the two complete practice sessions  all coders coded all   articles by following the process of coding in  dependently  discussing the results with a partner  and checking the results with the other pair   coding scheme  descriptive information about the articles such as authors  journal  and year of publication were recorded  all variables in the studies were recorded and the types of variables and relationships between the variables were specified  this information was used to answer rq  on  the nomological network of leader follower dyads  the theoretical basis of the studies  the type of dyads from which the study collected data  and the analytic methods were coded to answer rq   rq a  and rq b  respectively  for studies that used theories and methods other than the five theories and four primary methods discussed above  coders used an  other  code and noted the name of the other theories and methods  in addition  studies that used multiple theories or methods were given multiple codes  to answer rq   all variables included in the hypotheses involving dyadic variables were considered  and levels and dimensions   of these variables were coded  for example  when a variable was measured from both the leader s and follower s perspectives and combined  the level of the variable was coded as  dyad   on the other hand  when the variable was measured from either leader or follower  but not both  the level of the variable was coded as  individual   dimensions of each variable were coded as affect  behavior  cognition  or demographics based on the conceptualization   results  seventy nine articles included in the current review can be sum  marized by published years as shown in fig     since    the number  fig     article screening process based on inclusion criteria   j  kim  et al  the leadership quarterly             of leader follower dyads studies that include a dyad level variable has been increasing continuously   rq   results  a summary of leader follower dyad articles by theory is presented in table    forty six articles used one of the five theories reviewed above    six articles used one or multiple other theories    and   articles used either a combination of one of the five theories and other theories or a combination of two of the five theories to explain the phenomenon of interest    among the   articles that used one theory  leader follower congruence   was the most used theory for leader follower dyad studies  followed by lmx    in  dividualized leadership    and vdl     studies on leader follower congruence mainly focused on in  vestigating the effect of similarity dissimilarity of leader follower characteristics     or a leader s and a follower s perceptions    specifically  among the   articles    articles   studied the effects of demo  graphic similarity  studies on lmx examined the antecedents or con  sequences of dyadic lmx    studies on individualized leadership con  centrated on testing the levels of support for self worth and satisfying performance    vdl studies investigated an antecedent of vdl quality   and con  sequences of negotiation latitude     six articles that were based on other theories employed transfor  mational leadership  contingent reward leadership  relational control approach  or social exchange theory  regarding transformational  leadership and contingent reward leadership  the level of the theory and the level of the relationship between leadership behavior and outcomes were investigated    relational control approach was used to examine the dyadic conversation pattern    and social exchange theory was applied to develop an idea on the effect of a leader and a follower s commitment interaction on follower s job performance     regarding the   articles that applied two theories    articles were related to both leader follower congruence and lmx and examined the effect of a leader s and a follower s individual differences congruence on individual lmx perceptions   or the effect of lmx agreement on a follower s outcomes    four articles combined leader fol  lower congruence and other theories    two articles used lmx and other theories    and one article was based on vdl and individualized leadership   summary the results showed that the majority of the studies concentrated on  leader follower congruence or lmx and predicted outcomes of the leader follower relationship  in contrast  studies that used process or  iented theories  such as individualized leadership and relational lea  dership theory  were relatively limited  interestingly  several other theories such as transformational leadership and contingent reward leadership were applied to study leader follower dyadic phenomenon   rq  a results  the type of dyads assessed or used in each study is summarized in table    studies were coded as operationalizing the dyads as in  dependent dyads when the number of leaders and followers in the sample were identical  and as dependent dyads when dyad data were collected from groups teams and the number of leaders and followers were different    for dependent dyads studies  we coded whether the nested nature of the data was considered in the analyses  studies that did not report the number of both leaders and followers were coded as not specifying the type of dyads   of   articles    articles specified that dyadic data were collected from independent dyads    articles were based on data collected from dependent dyads    articles   did not specify the type of dyads used in the study  and two articles conducted multiple studies with different operationalizations  for example  guarana and barnes   collected data from independent dyads for the first study and from dependent dyads for the second study  and paustian underdahl  king  rogelberg  kulich  and gentry   did not provide adequate in  formation to discern the type of dyads in one study and collected de  pendent

nesting of dyads within groups or teams   the   articles used different methods to take the group level effects into consideration  waba was used to directly test whether the levels of the relationship of interest were at the dyad or group level    some studies used aggregation tests   to either eliminate the possibility of group level effect   or aggregate a group level variable    in the case of studies em  ploying multilevel modeling  variables related to leaders were included as group level variables to either control the nesting of dyads under a common leader or explain group level effects     summary as independent dyads   and de   pendent dyads   are conceptually distinct  and have the potential to involve different levels of analysis    the type of dyads included in the study needs to be specified and the requisite proper methodological attention should be given to the specified dyadic type    although most studies discussed the type of dyads  some studies failed to specify this explicitly  moreover  among the studies that collected data from dependent dyads  approximately one third of the studies did not con  sider the nesting of dyads within a group  the results suggest room for improvement in specifying the type of dyads and implementing meth  odological rigor when studying dependent dyads   rq  b results  a summary of leader follower dyad articles by method is shown in table    twenty six articles used one of the four dyadic research methods   reviewed above    eight articles used either a combination of one of the four methods and other methods or a combination of two of the four methods    and   articles used other methods     among the   articles that used one of the four methods  multilevel modeling and waba   were the most used method  followed by polynomial regression    and apim owm    multilevel modeling was used to consider both dyad level effects and group level effects  such as group phenomenon   or leader specific effects in groups    waba was employed to test whether the variables and associations of interest operated at the dyad level    polynomial regression was im  plemented in studies that focused on the effect of congruence and  incongruence of a leader s and a follower s characteristics perceptions     regarding the eight articles that used at least one of the four re  viewed methods and another method  two articles that used multilevel modeling conducted waba as an additional test for levels of the phe  nomenon of interest    one article that conducted structural equation modeling used waba to justify aggregation of the variable of interest    two articles that employed waba as a primary method used additional methods such as structural equation modeling   and correlations    two articles that applied polynomial regression used either multilevel modeling to eliminate the possibility of group level effects when using dependent dyad data   or structural equation modeling for mediation tests    and one article that had two studies employed regression and multilevel regression for each study     other methods used in the   articles were multiple linear regres  sion    anova manova    structural equation modeling path analysis    correlation    a mix of these methods      grizzle  starmer  and koch   approach      and simon blalock technique      studies using multiple linear regression used difference scores to represent dyad characteristics    and studies using anova manova employed categories of dyads to examine the difference in the outcomes of in  terest     summary less than a half of the articles   used at least  one of the methods reviewed here  and the rest of the articles used other methods such as multiple regression and anova manova  among the four reviewed dyadic research methods  when used either sepa  rately or in some combination  waba was the most utilized method and apim owm   was the least utilized method  the low usage of apim owm may be due to its relatively recent introduction compared to the other methods    given that apim owm can explain various research questions about dyads    more attention is needed to this method   rq   results  in total    hypotheses that included at least one dyad level vari  able were coded and   hypotheses received empirical support  based on the supported hypotheses for direct and indirect effects  we gener  ated a nomological network of leader follower dyads research as shown in figs        and     three clusters emerged in the nomological network and each cluster included different set of theories  the first cluster   included core variables of vdl    lmx  and leader follower congruence  the second cluster   was based on vdl and in  dividualized leadership    and the third cluster   was composed of variables studied using other leadership theories     in fig     leader follower  congruence was central  as it predicted numerous individual level  both leader related and

based variables and cognition based variables had either direct or indirect effects  affect based variables only had direct effects on outcomes    several mediators were iden  tified for the relationship between leader follower congruence and follower related individual level outcomes   and follower rated lmx was one of the mediators   regarding lmx at the dyad level  two different approaches emerged in the nomological network  the first approach  which was examining the effect of lmx agreement   between a leader and a follower    appeared in the first cluster    as this approach reflects the congruence between a leader s and a follower s perception  it was ca  tegorized under cognition based leader follower congruence  lmx  agreement predicted perceived performance at the dyad level  a follo  wer s work engagement  extra role behavior  and turnover intention   the second approach to study lmx at the dyad level  which was generating a dyad level lmx score as an aggregate of leader rated and follower rated lmx  appeared in the third cluster    this ag  gregated lmx score was used to mediate the effect of individual fo  cused transformational leadership occurring at the dyad level and fol  lower s in role and extra role behavior   and the relationship between the leader s emotional intelligence and follower  related outcomes such as psychological well being and turnover in  tention     fig    was formulated around vdl and individualized leadership  different dyad level variables were present and the relationships among the variables were

leadership predicted a follower s outcomes such as job satisfaction  extra role performance  and in role performance    in addition  contingent reward leadership was also related to dyad level performance and shared perception of subordinate commitment at the dyad level     summary the nomological network included three clusters  the first cluster  was built based on leader follower congruence and lmx  the second cluster was formulated with variables mainly studied from an in  dividualized leadership standpoint and included multiple dyad level variables    the third cluster included other theories studied at the dyad level    most of the outcomes in the first cluster were individual level outcomes such as performance  job satisfaction  and turnover intention  among the studies on leader follower congruence  most of the studies focused on a leader s and a follower s individual differences that were manifested before the dyadic relationship began     in the nomological network  lmx has been employed more as an individual level variable than a dyad level variable  only two ante  cedents of dyad level lmx were identified and outcomes of dyad level lmx were all individual level outcomes  in line with gooty et al    s review on levels issue in lmx research  despite lmx being one of the most studied leader follower dyadic phenomena  relatively little is known about dyad level lmx   rq   results  variables investigated in leader follower dyads studies can be ca  tegorized into either variables that represent characteristics of dyads   or outcome variables operating at levels other than dyad level  a list of dyad level variables and dimensions of each variable is presented in table    and a list of outcome variables and dimension of each variable is summarized in table    dimensions  were determined based on the conceptualization of each variable and coded as affect  behavior  cognition  or demographics   in total    dyad level variables were identified  among the iden  tified variables    variables were used as one type of variable with   variables as an independent variable    variables as a moderator  one variable as a mediator  and   variables as a dependent variable  six variables were used as multiple types of variables and  among them  three variables were used as both an independent variable and a de  pendent variable   regarding the dimensions of the variables    out of   were based on cognition  the majority of cognition based variables were related to  similarity or  congruence between two individuals  character  istics   or perceptions of particular target such as relationship quality    role  or performance rating  seventeen variables were conceptually related to behavior oc  curring within dyads such as attention  building and mending re  lationship  leadership behavior  support for self worth  and perfor  mance    of the   variables categorized as affect variables  except  similarity or  congruence of anger  emotional irritation  and emotional intelligence between a leader and a follower  all variables were conceptually a mix of the affective aspect and cog  nitive aspect such as lmx  satisfaction  and commitment  four variables were identified as capturing relatively objective characteristics such as demographics    dyadic tenure  re  lationship type  and guanxi as a former relationship type between a leader and a follower   individual level outcomes studied in leader follower dyads studies   were categorized into follower related outcomes and leader  related outcomes  forty two variables were identified as follower re  lated outcomes  in terms of the conceptual dimensions of the follower  related outcomes  cognition   was the most studied aspect  followed by behavior   and affect    among the follower related outcomes  nine variables   were considered to be capturing multiple aspects     regarding leader related outcomes    variables were found and behavior   was the most studied dimension  followed by affect   and cognition    among the leader  related outcomes  four variables   were a mix of multiple dimensions    individual level     dyad

quarterly             cognition  affect and behavior  mix of all three dimensions    summary in terms of dyad level variables  a small number of variables were  identified as outcome variables and most of the variables were either independent variables or moderators  in other words  few variables have been investigated as purely dyadic outcomes  in addition  di  mensions of dyad level variables were mostly cognitions   with regard to outcomes of leader follower dyads  all variables were at the individual level and mostly related to followers  again  outcomes were also heavily focused on cognitive aspects  these results guide future research to further explore and investigate more dyad level outcomes and consider dimensions other than cognitions   discussion  by focusing on the dyad level in the realm of leadership and going beyond extant reviews on leader follower dyads    lmx research    and lmx agreement    the current review broadly examined empirical findings in leader

quarterly             dimensionality of variables covered in dyads research  our review results indicate that little has been uncovered in terms of  pure dyadic phenomena between leaders and followers  in other words  leader follower dyads research field has a potential to expand widely in the future  by looking at the nomological network generated and the summary on the usage of theories on leader follower dyads from this review  researchers will be able to identify areas that need future in  vestigation for replication and to expand the nomological network to enhance our knowledge of dyadic phenomena  moreover  researchers can try replicating the findings of leader follower dyadic phenomena investigated with early methods   by employing more contemporary methods suggested for dyadic research  when applicable   in general  to expand our understanding of leader follower dyads  future studies on leader follower dyads should pay closer attention to the levels of theory  measurement  analysis  and inference  as suggested by other reviews on levels of analysis issues in leadership research    ad  ditionally  future research can align the levels issues at the dyad level by addressing research questions on areas that have gained limited interest in the nomological network of leader follower dyads and em  ploy dyad level analysis with matched data collected from both leaders and followers   based on the findings of the current review  we can summarize when it is necessary to consider both the leader s and follower s per  spective and make suggestions in terms of future research questions and methods to further develop the areas that received limited attention in leader follower dyads research  for example  it is important to take a dyadic perspective when researchers are interested in dyadic phe  nomena such as      interaction process  reciprocity  and or exchange between a leader and a follower      the interplay of a leader s and a follower s individual characteristics     the agreement disagreement between a leader s and a follower s  perceptions  and     emergent properties  components  and characteristics of dyadic re   lationships

formulation of dyadic relationships and how do the components interact to build the relationships        what properties emerge after interactions exchange between a leader and a follower and how long do these elements take to emerge within the dyad      for leader follower congruence studies  what affect  and behavior  based individual differences can be matched in a dyad to predict individual and dyadic outcomes      what dyad characteristics can impact better worse leader follower congruence        what dyad level consequences can be predicted from leader fol  lower dyadic relationships     finally  suggestions for methodology include      when interested in dyadic phenomenon  collect data on the variable of interest from both a leader s and a follower s perspective and combine  when appropriate  responses from the two perspectives to generate a dyad level variable  when aggregation of dyad scores of the focal variable is necessary  test the level of the variable via waba or some other appropriate technique after combining the responses      specify the type of dyads   collected in the study by providing the number of both leaders and followers in the sample      when dyads are dependent    consider the dependency in the analysis by either testing the potential group level effects through waba or calculating iccs  for example  before conducting dyad  level analyses  or conduct multilevel   modeling to consider both dyad level effects and group level effects     in a more general way  we believe the results of this review point toward several broad potential future directions for research related to leader follower dyads  first  there is a great need to unpack and explore the temporal dynamics of leader follower relationships  the process  oriented theories related to leader follower dyads   have received very little empirical attention from a pure dyad perspective  this is unfortunate as dyadic phenomena do not always emerge from leader follower inter  actions    and it would be helpful to know how the various temporal dynamics suggested by existing theories inform our understanding of these rea  lities  moreover  given the potential value of high quality leader fol  lower dyadic relationships to positively impact an array of important outcomes    it would be insightful to enhance understanding of factors that could accelerate the rate of development for these re  lationships   there is no doubt that the longitudinal studies needed to explore such leader follower relationships are challenging  they require in  tensive repeated data collection and additional modeling complexities    however  recent advances in big data and the increasing availability of  digital traces    may ease the  collection of repeated data for both leaders and followers  additionally  there are likely to be ways to combine existing dyadic data analysis methodologies with multilevel modeling and other growth modeling techniques   to address modeling com  plexities  lastly  there are potentially interesting ways in which com  putational models agent based simulations can be coupled with tar  geted empirical studies   to shed light on and investigate important temporal aspects in  volved with the development and maintenance of leader follower dyadic phenomena   second  there is room to further investigate the conceptual com  plexities involved with dependent leader follower dyads  while this review demonstrates that these types of dyads are common  much of existing research has focused on the methodological implications of these dyads  the unique theoretical implications associated with these types of dyads  such as the potential for there to be contagion and other diffusion effects among leader follower dyads in a given group and the possibility for characteristics associated with follower follower dyads to impact leader follower dyads  have yet to be incorporated into existing theories regarding leader follower dyads  such considerations are likely to be particularly important as scholarship in this area more fully in  vestigates the temporal aspects involved with the development and maintenance of leader follower dyadic phenomena   third  we see potential for the use of network related approaches to examine leader follower dyadic phenomena  the dyad is a fundamental unit of analysis in network based approaches  and it offers the added benefit of providing the ability to visualize and explore the broader pattern and configuration of dyads in a given unit    despite these applicable and potentially insightful aspects of network based methods  this review did not identify any  pure  dyad leadership studies that used network techniques  there is thus an op  portunity to leverage network approaches  particularly exponential random graph models   and associated multilevel extensions    in future leader follower dyads studies   fourth  there are opportunities to explore the bottom up impact of dyad level phenomena and outcomes on phenomena at a higher level of analysis beyond the dyad  while this review found that the examination of dyad level outcomes was relatively rare    consideration of the impact at the group team or higher levels of analysis was practi  cally nonexistent  this is surprising as dyads are frequently referred to as the fundamental building blocks of groups teams and are likely to play an important role in the emergence of a variety of group team phenomena      moreover  prior research suggests that leader follower dyads are likely to be a particularly salient set of dyads in a given group team    we therefore see possibilities for future theoretical and empirical research on leader follower dyads to enhance understanding of how the dynamics and outcomes associated with these dyads can impact phenomena and outcomes at the group team levels of analysis   finally  given our review of pure leader follower dyad relationships  we believe it is premature to offer specific practical implications when we do not know much about leader follower dyads yet  if leader fol  lower dyads research expands by addressing more diverse research questions and including more constructs  and the findings are re  plicated  then we would be able to provide practical implications such as how to build high performing dyadic relationships  how to manage low quality dyadic relationships  and what leaders and followers can expect from their good poor dyadic relationships  until that point in the development of this line of research    we believe that it is prudent scientifically to avoid asserting practical implications when  j  kim  et al  the leadership quarterly             they are not warranted or may be inaccurate   conclusion  the current review presents a summary of leader follower dyads research and identifies areas that have been understudied and require additional theoretical and empirical attention  we also have provided suggestions regarding several new promising directions for future re  search on leader follower dyads to explore  our overall hope is that these findings stimulate greater specificity in future leader follower dyads research  increase the appropriate investigation of purely dyadic phenomena between leaders and followers  and lay the groundwork for a new wave of research related to leader follower dyads

leadership topics  it has been an annual mainstay of the journal since the yearly review was introduced in    the   issue follows that tradition and aspires to extend and enhance contributions to leadership science  the process to publication involves a rigorous  peer review system described in more detail in the following paragraph  the im  portance afforded to the yearly review issue is such that it appears as the first published issue in february for each volume of the journal   there are a few features that make the yearly review distinct from regular issues of the journal  as the yearly review editor  i am re  sponsible for this category of articles in consultation with the editor in chief  a competitive call is published early each year for authors to submit a   page proposal  plus all end matter  each proposal is first screened by me and the editor in chief  proposals that are judged to be in scope and are sufficiently well developed are sent out for review  proposals receive detailed feedback from at least two reviewers for the authors to consider and address in their respective full manuscripts  point by point responses to the reviewers  comments are required along with submission of the review manuscript  invitation to submit a full manuscript does not guarantee eventual publication  however  the re  viewers and i work in a constructive and developmental manner to enhance the publication potential of each manuscript  typically  full manuscripts undergo at least two and typically more revisions before a final decision is made with regard to publication suitability in the yearly review  these articles take the form of narrative reviews  in  tegrations  meta analyses  and other formats related to the focal topic of leadership  broadly defined   in terms of article scope  we seek to publish reviews on substantive areas of leadership theory and research  or to address relevant metho  dological issues  in particular  we seek to publish articles that have the potential to launch a new line of research  redirect existing research streams  propose concrete research agendas  or shut down areas of scholarship that are no longer relevant or have ceased making mean  ingful contributions to the field  what we do not typically publish in the yearly review are theory development pieces into new areas of lea  dership science  those types of papers should be submitted for review to the regular issue or a relevant special issue  regardless of focus or approach  we strive for yearly review articles to be  pushing the en  velope  in the respective area of leadership being reviewed  authors are encouraged to take a stand  be provocative  and even stir some con  troversy  if needed   the current issue comprises   articles that review relevant  leadership literature and forge directions for future researchers to build on  the lead article focuses on an important methodological topic by providing an introduction  review  and guidelines for conducting nat  ural experiments in the leadership field    other articles in the issue include a review and critique of the  healthy leadership  literature   and ex  amining the contemporary topic of leading teams in the digital age    reviewing much of what is known on leadership and technology  additional reviews include the topics of functional leadership in multi  and inter team contexts    leader follower transgressions and relationship repair and outcomes    si  tuation trait approaches and situation encoding schema in leader de  cision making    leadership in and of socio political vanguards  also known as political fringe groups    examining what we know about the daily causes and consequences of leadership behaviors on what is called everyday lea  dership    follower transformation as the foundation of transformational leadership theory    evolution based dual strategies for un  derstanding leadership in modern organizations    leader follower dyads    and leadership succession in business and political organizations    the final article provides a review of the literature pub  lished during the third decade of the leadership quarterly   following an informal tradition that takes decennial perspectives on the accumulation of leadership science in the journal  it is a diverse and wide ranging collection of article topics that will cer  tainly stimulate   and possibly even provoke   your thinking about leadership research  theory  and methods  in keeping with the spirit of the journal and its international focus  the authorship teams in this volume represent multiple countries and continents   in closing  on behalf of the authors and myself  many thanks to the reviewers for their constructive and developmental comments that ul  timately improved every article in this issue  looking ahead  i en  courage future authors to consider submitting their proposals for future yearly review issues that consider timely and provocative

published in lq  including the period       and        the present work complements and expands the first two reviews by documenting how the field has evolved with new characters  methodologies  and theories emerging while others decline and become less relevant  we extend the story of how lq emerged from a start up niche journal  evolved into the predominant outlet for leadership research and new theories  gained awareness of a growing need to reduce construct proliferation  and adopted increasingly sophisticated methodological techniques that call into question some of the field s prior research findings   introduction  the purpose of this manuscript is to review the most recent ten years       of the research published in the leadership quarterly  in preparing this review  we follow on prior decade focused reviews published in the leadership quarterly    including the period       and        we maintained key features of past reviews to provide comparability over time while introducing new features and variables  including a revised leadership taxonomy    that reflects the evolution of the leadership field over lq s third decade  in doing so  we address topics and trends which may be of interest to readers of lq specifically  and more broadly to those who read and publish leadership research across a range of journals   ode to the past  prelude to the present  lowe and gardner   chronicled  catalogued  and classified the first decade of lq  originally conceived by bernard bass  bob house  and henry tosi over dinner in    the primary rationales for founding lq were two fold  first  it was to provide a focused outlet for the publication of leadership research by scholars from management  psychology  and other disciplines which  at the time  were scattered  over a wide range of journals  second  it was to provide an inter  disciplinary home for leadership research that would create a virtuous cycle of stimulating perspectives across diverse disciplines that would broaden the impact of leadership scholarship to spur cross disciplinary theoretical and methodological innovations   in its first decade  lq published   articles ranging from a low of   articles in the founding year to a high of   articles in the concluding issue of the decade  nine special issues  spanning a range of topics in  cluding   degree feedback  diversity  levels of analysis  political leadership  and environmental change  were an important part of at  tracting manuscripts to lq in its founding years  fifty five percent of the articles were empirical and    were theoretical or review pieces  neo charismatic approaches   were by far the most widely employed theoretical underpinning   in lq s first decade  the second highest number of articles published in the first ten years did not fall neatly into a specific domain of leadership theory based on the taxonomy in use and thus were classified as  new directions     this finding suggested  at least prima facie  that the journal was deli  vering on the stated purpose of being open to innovation   in summarizing the progress of lq over its first decade  lowe and gardner   concluded that lq had     made substantial progress toward its meta goal of being the leading scholarly journal for    received   november    received in revised form   december    accepted   december    ⁎ corresponding author at

inc   t                  leadership theory and research    and    successfully moved from being a new journal to one that was more established for pro  moting leadership research  the authors suggested that lq s second decade would offer an important opportunity to solidify the journal s emergent position as a place to publish and obtain the best in leadership research   in lq s second decade gardner et al    catalogued   pub  lished articles as compared to   in the first decade   an increase of     this significant growth in the number of published articles was achieved by increasing the number of publications per issue and in  creasing this  quarterly  journal to six issues each year  the number of pages grew from   in the first decade to   in the second dec  ade an increase of     the increased number of articles and pages did not come at the expense of quality  as the journal s impact factor continued to climb in the second decade  as indicated by the upward trend from      to      and      once again  special issues played an important role in attracting high quality leadership research to lq with   special issues published  a near doubling of the nine in the prior decade  fifty five percent of the articles were empirical    and    were theoretical or review pieces    a remarkably consistent pattern over multiple time periods and editors  neo charismatic approaches were again the most frequently employed theoretical category with   articles pub  lished in the second decade as compared to   neo charismatic articles in the first  however  this absolute increase masks the more interesting relative decrease in the influence of the neo charismatic paradigm which declined to    of all articles versus    in the first decade  gardner et al    observed an even more dramatic change in the proportion of theories categorized as new directions  the new direc  tions category exploded from    of all articles in the first decade to    of all articles in the second  theoretical perspectives identified as new directions included  contextual influences on leadership  devel  opment and identification of leaders and leadership  ethical  servant  spiritual  and authentic leadership  leading for creativity and innova  tion  strategic leadership by top executives  leadership in teams and decision groups  political and public leadership  complexity theory of leadership  leadership effects of task  technology  distance  and vir  tuality  ideological and pragmatic leadership  destructive leadership  and leading change in organizations   the resurgence of interest in leadership research  spurred in part by the neo charismatic paradigms  prompted gardner et al    to abandon the leadership taxonomy used in the prior decade s review  in an effort to more carefully describe a vibrant field that was experien  cing many innovations in theoretical development as well as the methods employed to test those theories  they developed a more con  temporary leadership taxonomy  which remains influential in the de  velopment of more recent taxonomies of leadership theory     the expansion of the journal over its second decade in terms of volume and prominence supports the notion that the journal was de  livering on the stated purpose of advancing the understanding of lea  dership as a phenomenon  how to study it  as well as its practical im  plications for organizations  in summarizing the progress of lq over its second decade  gardner et al    concluded that     the field of leadership was more diverse and robust than at any time in recent decades     there was clear evidence that lq had played an important role in advancing the field theoretically and methodologically  and    that lq had solidified its position as the leading outlet focused on publishing rigorous leadership research   we include this brief overview of lq s journey over the first two decades because it provides the context for grounding our current re  view  in this review we seek  as our focal purpose  to describe the content of the journal over the period      while our primary focus is on the content in the most recent decade  we also seek to compare  on several dimensions  the content of the journal s third  decade with that of prior decades  we make this historical comparison because a secondary purpose of our manuscript is to continue telling the story of the evolution of the leadership quarterly  a story where the first two chapters have been written in ten year increments    in doing so  we seek to provide updated answers to the broad research questions we have asked in prior reviews such as  what is published in lq and by whom   who has provided editorial leadership for the journal and how has the compo  sition   changed during the decade  what are the topical characteristics   and content   of the research that appears in lq   is lq the primary outlet for quality leadership research  to what extent has lq met its mission  what is the trajectory of the journal and what might that vantage point suggest about the next decade of research that will be published in lq  in addition  we ask new questions  including  where does leadership data come from  what proportion of articles employ multiple methods studies   in preparing this review  we are mindful that the leadership field has been fortunate to have multiple excellent comprehensive reviews of the leadership literature in recent years  dinh et al    utilized a process oriented framework to review   leadership articles published in ten leading journals over a thirteen year period    in doing so  their focus was on developing a better taxonomy of leadership theory that considered both forms of emergence and levels of analysis  meuser et al    reviewed   leadership articles published in ten top journals over a fourteen year period    using graphic network analysis  they drew conclusions about the state of theoretical integration in leadership research and identified theoretical neighbor  hoods where focal and supporting leadership theories tended to con  gregate  zhu  song  zhu  and johnson   conducted a bibliometric analysis of co citation and co occurrence in   leadership articles over a   year period   in an effort to describe the de  velopmental trajectory of leadership research over time in terms of significant authors and journals  zhao and li   likewise conducted a bibliographic analysis of leadership theories over the same   year time span  but rather than manually coding documents to create a single map of   leadership theories  they  used software tools to code and organize     leadership articles authored by     authors and published in   academic journals     next  they used the vosviewer  version         to visually represent the inductively derived taxonomies of   popular leadership research topics  as well as the collaboration networks of   highly productive leadership scholars  lord  day  zaccaro  avolio  and eagly   reviewed leadership research published in the journal of applied psychology over a   year period    rather than comprehensively including all articles published over that period as was done in the other reviews just described  the approach of lord et al  was  selective  emphasizing those publications that represented or sparked unique turns and conceptual developments in the literature  a subjective task that drew on our combined experience in the leadership field      while these reviews are useful and influential  the current review is substantively different in terms of scope  scale  and focus  the scope of this manuscript  in terms of variables of interest  is distinct from these other reviews which focused squarely on developing a theoretical tax  onomy    providing a network of co citations    mapping the field of leadership using artificial intelligence    examining the level of theoretical integration    or looking for seminal inflection points in the long range trajectory of a journal    in coding for leadership theory  our work resembles that of dinh et al     meuser et al     and zhu et al     but we also code for a range of variables including study design  sample characteristics  methods employed    and author attributes  to name just a few  that were not considered in those reviews  our article is similar to lord et al    in that we focus on a single journal   w l  gardner  et al  the leadership quarterly             highlight some of the most cited work  and describe the contents of the journal using theoretical themes  but our approach is markedly dif  ferent as we comprehensively code each article   and weight each article in a dispassionate manner in our content analysis   we are able to achieve increased scope  as compared to other re  views through more focus   and by reduced scale    we also differentiate our review by noting that dinh et al    and meuser et al    have   and   respectively as their end of analysis years  so  our sample periods have relatively little overlap  collectively  our review is substantially differentiated from other recent reviews of the literature not only in scope and focus  but also by the time period reviewed  finally  because our review of lq s third decade follows a similar approach to that of the reviews for its first and second decades  we can report on trends in this journal over a third point in time   having situated the current review of lq s most recent decade in the context of prior decade reviews and recent reviews of the leadership literature  we turn to a description of the approach and content of this review  multiple methods were used to prepare this review including quantitative techniques and qualitative analyses  our content analysis examines the type of article    con  tributors    theoretical foundations  research strategies  sample type  data collec  tion measures and methods  and analytical procedures across the decade  embedded in this discussion are an assessment of the top in  stitutional contributors  the number  focus  and role of special issues  and a citation analysis of the decade s most cited articles  following from the content analysis  we provide summary level observations about the content and trajectory of research published in lq over the most recent decade  comparing that to the previous two decades of lq  we conclude with directions for future research by revisiting the re  commendations offered in the prior lq decade reviews and assess the extent to which those recommendations have been fulfilled by the field  we also share observations from the three scholars who served as edi  tors during lq s third decade on the trends in the topics and methods used to extend our knowledge of leadership theory and practice   methods  we coded many of the variables found in the lowe and gardner    gardner et al     and dinh et al    reviews  while adding some new features  we coded article type  expanding on the typology of dinh et al     qualitative  quantitative  theory  method  special issue  and review issue  we utilized a slightly modified version of the gardner et al  typology of methods as expanded by dinh et al   computer simulation  content analysis  diary study experience sampling method    lab experiment  field study    field survey    field experiment  experimental simula  tion  quasi experiment  judgment task  meta analysis    and review    to which we added convenience sampling  interviews  observation  and archival data  rather than use the gardner et al  case study qualitative study category  we employed the expanded typology of cresswell and poth   for quali  tative designs     narrative     phenomenological     grounded theory     ethnographic  and    case study  we followed the quantitative analytical method typology employed by scandura and williams    gardner et al     and dinh et al     specifically  we coded for whether the article used     simple statistics only       analysis of variance   or analysis of covariance       computer simulations       linear regression     linear techniques for categorical dependent vari  ables     structural equation modeling   path analysis     mul  tiple levels of analysis techniques       meta analytic techniques       non parametric techniques  and    time  series event history techniques    after an initial round of coding  we expanded this typology to include     two stage least squares          network analyses       curvilinear ana  lyses    and    dominance relative weight analysis   new to this decade review  we elected to explore construct validation over the last decade  for this reason  we moved and separated factor analysis into two categories     confirmatory factor analysis    and    exploratory factor analysis    to this  we added     internal consistency reliability estimates       interrater reliability       rwg       icc        icc        within and between analysis       test  retest reliability     split half reliability     cohen s kappa     con  sensus coding  we also coded     convergent     discriminant     face  and    predictive validities  but only if the authors discussed these explicitly  we recorded if the authors reported reliability information for     all relevant variables     only some relevant variables  or if reliability was    not applicable for some or    not applicable for all variables  continuing the trend of interest in measures  we also recorded if the authors reported employing     existing measures     modified existing measures     a new measure created for the study     difference scores  or    unobtrusive measures   another new feature of our review that differentiates it from others involves coding where  when  and from whom authors acquired their data  we develop the following data source typology     self focal       peer of focal       follower of focal       leader of focal       family of focal       customer of focal       company archival records       third party archival records         rater provided    and when the referent in question is the    team or    or  ganization  we also coded from which country the sample was drawn  we coded when these data were collected using the following typology     cross sectional       cross sectional with a time lag    or     longitudinal    our sample type typology is     private company       public        military     health care     non governmental organization       purpose theoretical sampling       snowball sampling     mturk     qualtrics panel     other online third party sampling tool     undergraduate non working students     undergraduate working students     grad  uate mba non working students  or    graduate mba working stu  dents  or    sample not reported  in student samples  we recorded the percent of working students when that information was available  student samples where work was not mentioned were coded as non  working   for leadership theory  we employed the taxonomy provided in meuser et al     which is available on the journal of management s website as supplemental material    this built on the taxonomies in lowe and gardner    which gardner et al     and dinh et al    expanded and refined  we coded the primary leadership theory  which we call the focal theory  present in the article  like meuser et al   we found that some articles employed an integrated view such that no  w l  gardner  et al  the leadership quarterly                 single theory was focal  and these were coded as such  we also recorded author affiliations and locations as given in the  article  as well as author gender and discipline in order to explore the composition of authorship teams  we acknowledge that gender was coded in a binary fashion   for this research  finally  to ascertain the extent to which the composition of lq s editorial team leadership reflects the type of diversity of disciplines and international backgrounds that the founding editors sought to achieve    we collected information on the disciplines  institu  tions  and roles of the scholars who served as an associate editor   for lq during its third decade     editorial leadership of lq in its third decade  three scholars served as the editor in chief of lq during its third decade  michael   mumford  leanne atwater  and john antonakis  mike mumford took over from jerry hunt in   and served as editor during a pivotal period of lq s development  as he oversaw a sizable increase in submissions    increases in the number of articles published  special issues on a range of diverse topics    and substantial increases in the impact factor    the  journal also became more international and embraced a growing di  versity of theoretical perspectives and methods    all of the aes were united states citizens by birth  and reflected the disciplines of management  psychology  and philo  sophy by training  a complete summary of the disciplines  institutions  roles  and years of appointment for all scholars who served as aes during lq s third decade is provided in table     leanne atwater assumed the role of editor in chief in   and served in that role until      during her tenure she introduced several innovations  including automated submission and review process  changes to roles and responsibilities of the aes    and a further increase in the size and interna  tional composition of the editorial review board  in addition  the number of submissions continued to grow rapidly  increasing from   in   to   in      while acceptance rates declined from    in   to    in    during atwater s tenure  lq continued to publish high quality special issues on relevant topics such as cognition  emotion  gender  network approaches  biology  asian models  and longitudinal studies    finally  during her tenure five lq articles were  retracted to protect the integrity

  senior associate editor  w l  gardner  et al  the leadership quarterly             in issuing these retractions is described in an editorial by atwater et al     mirroring procedures put in place across much of the social sciences  the ultimate consequence of the retractions has been a re  commitment to ensuring the rigor and accuracy of research published in lq through a number of refinements to journal review processes    as described below   john antonakis has served as the editor in chief from   to the present  he is the first lq editor to hail from a continent other than north america  indeed  his background is truly unique as he is  the first european editor in chief  a swiss who is u s  trained  having a south african accent and a greek surname       additionally  he again expanded the number of aes to include  five senior associate editors and nine associate editors  and a junior as  sociate editor  that assists with article screening  and the size of the editorial board    while further in  creasing the disciplinary and cultural diversity represented among its members    disciplines that are represented within the editorial leadership for the first time through the appointment of aes with significant expertise in these fields include behavioral eco  nomics  political science  evolutionary and biological psychology  social psychology  research methods  and strategy and organization theory    in addition  greater international representation is ap  parent among the aes  with scholars from europe and australia  in addition to north america   antonakis also instituted several changes to lq s policies and pro  cesses  he expanded the types of articles that lq publishes to in  clude in addition to full length articles  lq yearly review of leadership articles  and special issue articles short communications  commen  taries of published articles  and research proposals    he initially increased the desk reject rate from the    level of the prior editorial team to roughly     to  use editorial and reviewer resources wisely and efficiently     at the same time  he charged aes to  spend their time making substantive and constructive comments on manuscripts with potential    further  in a section of a position paper   titled   how to make a more useful contribution to the research record   he challenged submitting authors to strive to make more meaningful contributions through  better theorizing  not ignoring endogeneity  designing realistic experiments  conducting rigorous qualitative re  search  declaring conflicts of interest  being transparent with data  methods and reporting  and being an honest broker     finally  prior to an empirical manuscript being accepted  the methods advisor ae now conducts a check  to ensure that reporting guidelines are followed  that there are no flaws in reporting and ana  lysis  and that limitations are transparently reported  and hence the manuscript is  squeaky clean      early returns on these changes are quite positive  as lq s impact factor has risen from     in   to     in    this impact factor places lq  th among applied psychology journals and  th among management journals in the most recent rankings    additionally  analyses in a recent  state of the journal  editorial indicate that citations to lq articles within management  applied psychology  and outside disciplines   are increasing rapidly and at rates that compare favorably with those of other and more established manage  ment and applied psychology top tier journals    however  what matters most to the leadership of lq is not impact factor per se  which  despite its flaws  is used extensively to judge journal quality  instead    w hat we care most about is to ensure that we report on how leadership works by publishing quality science  science that is robust  creative  and will make a difference      all three of lq s editors during lq s third decade identified a goal to increase both the size and the diversity of lq s editorial board  an ex  amination of changes in the size and composition of the board over the past decade suggests that some progress in achieving this goal has been made  during the decade  the size of the board increased from   to   members  while the percentage of female members increased from approximately   to     the geographic representation of the board has also

   unrepresented in    asia  is represented by the countries of singapore and turkey   in    through these changes  lq has moved closer to fulfilling the vision of the founding editors to be a global outlet for leadership research   what has lq published in its third decade and by whom   number and types of articles  next  we investigated the number and mix of article types by year    the second decade of lq showed a marked increase in publications over the first decade    the number of arti  cles in the third decade remained constant on average   as compared to the second decade  as gardner et al    noted  the increase from the first to second decade reflects the move from four to six volumes per year  we found a large range of published articles per year within the decade    showed the largest number of published articles   and   the smallest    moreover    and earlier showed significantly more published articles than   to present    january   corresponds to a change in editorship  with john antonakis taking over for leanne at  water  who concluded her term in december    as previously noted  john antonakis increased the proportion of desk rejects  producing a reduction in the number of articles published and an increase in rigor   overall       of articles involved quantitative exploration of phenomena  followed by qualitative    theory    and methods   articles  membership in these categories is not mu  tually exclusive  for example  an article could involve a mixed methods approach  employing both qualitative and quantitative exploration techniques  these percentages show a marked change from   to    where theoretical articles accounted for       methods articles  continued to decline  suggesting  as gardner et al    did  that editors may wish to stimulate methods related submissions when this type of scholarship is called for to advance the exploration of a phe  nomenon  alternatively  it may be that the reason why methods or  iented articles have declined is that there is now an organization studies journal devoted to publishing methods oriented articles organizational research methods  while the number and proportion of articles in re  view issues remains stable    the number of special issue articles has remained similar but the proportion has decreased markedly    review issues continue to be highly cited  as two of the top three most cited articles of the decade   were published in this forum   special issues  special issues   represent a significant investment of journal resources in a topic area  in total  there were   special issues published or initiated during the decade  which is an increase from nine and   in the prior two decades  respectively  the diversity of topics reflect many emerging areas of leadership methods and research  including the biology of leadership    asian models of leadership    collective and network approaches to leadership    leadership and economics    and leadership in the digital era    the variety of these special issue topics demonstrates a con  tinuing commitment to the vision of lq s founders to advance leader  ship knowledge through multi  and interdisciplinary research     in their review of lq s second decade  gardner et al    noted that the proliferation of lq special issues was part of a larger trend across top management journals identified by olk and griffith    drawing from archival data and interviews with journal editors  olk and griffith collected data on the quality and impact of special issues for five top tier management journals    gardner et al    observed that the proportion of lq special issues published during the journal s second decade   was roughly equivalent to  table   article type   year article count volume qualitative quantitative theory methods special issue review issue total

while the proportion of special issues   declined during lq s third decade  it is clear that they continue to play a pivotal role in introducing new theories and methods to the discipline   from their analysis  olk and griffith   concluded that articles published in special issues are characterized by greater upward var  iance in quality   and significantly higher citation rates than regular issues  these finding are consistent with those obtained by smith  leggat  and araki    who assessed the bibliographic performance and relative impact of a   special issue from the japanese journal  industrial health  specifically  smith et al    concluded  that special issues can attract more immediate citations and more overall citations than regular issues as well as having a positive effect on its impact factor in the years immediately following publication   gardner et al    came to a similar conclusion regarding articles published in special issues during lq s second decade  as they accounted for   of the top   most cited articles  even though they constituted only    of the total  however  special issue articles appear to have been less impactful during lq s third decade  as only   of the top   most cited articles   appeared in special issues  perhaps  as the topics of lq special issues have grown more focused on particularized and nascent streams of research  their appeal to a wider audience of leadership scholars has declined  at least relative to the prior decade  however  it would be premature to con  clude that lq special issues are not more impactful than articles pub  lished in regular issues  according to scopus data as of december       special issue articles in the third decade have been cited     times on average compared to     for regular articles  to further an  swer this question  a more systematic bibliographic analysis along the lines of that conducted by smith et al    is required  which is beyond the scope of the current review  moreover  as suggested above  we recommend that lq editors continue to publish special issues to help fulfill the journal s ongoing mission to serve as the outlet for cutting edge and multi disciplinary leadership research   review issues  with the dawn of the new millennium  lq editor jerry hunt   launched the inaugural lq yearly review of leadership     with this series  jerry displayed his tremendous talent as a visionary and leading edge thinker in bringing us a series of articles from top and emerging scholars not only in leadership  but in other areas jerry saw that could inform leadership      from the outset  the purpose of the lqyr issue was to provide state of the art coverage of a wide range of content and methodologically oriented pieces  to be complemented by subsequent special issues for some of the featured topics  it was hoped that over time  a wide range of reviews would be provided and serve as a baseline for future work by leadership scholars and others interested in the field of leadership   the lqyr reviews were not designed to be encyclopedic  though some are more encyclopedic than others  depending on the topic they needed to have some kind of integrating framework and generally be understandable by both specialists and generalists   reviews vary in their breadth but are representative of the topic area selected  and they cover a time period appropriate to tie in with previous work and provide a re  presentative picture of where the topic stands      a summary of the year  volume  issue  title  editor  and themes of the lqyr issues published in lq s third decade is provided in table    note that from its inception in   until    the lqyr issue ap  peared in the last issue of the volume  which was issue   until the number

quarterly             issues of lq s third decade appeared in issue    however  with the change of editors from leanne atwater to john antonakis in    antonakis decided to publish the lqyr in issue    where it has ap  peared every year thereafter  as such  no lqyr issue was published in     for the first decade   of the lqyr  each issue included reviews on a diverse set of substantive topics  and hence they did not reflect a theme per se  however  the   issue edited by fran yammarino    served as a scholarly tribute to two prominent leadership scholars and former lq editors   bernard m    bass and jerry hunt  who had recently passed away  from   to    chet schriesheim served as the lqyr editor  in    he introduced a theme for the first time  as the lqyr focused on methodological ad  vances in leadership research    the next two lqyr issues likewise had a thematic focus  as both featured articles that ad  vanced traditional leadership theory and research    none of the subsequent lqyr issues have had a thematic focus  however  the last three edited by shelley dionne and david day  re  spectively  reflect  multi disciplinary  multilevel  multisource  multi  skilled and multigenerational perspectives     and seek to push the  frontiers of leadership scholarship     through  state of the science reviews of leadership theory  methods  and measurement     over the years  this  series has become a cornerstone of lq  and the impact is demonstrated by the fact that  since its inception  lqyr articles have been regular recipients of the best paper award in lq  making it  a noble endeavor  and an ongoing tribute to jerry hunt s legacy    it is also noteworthy that a disproportionate number of lqyr articles   are included among the   most highly cited articles discussed in the next section    providing further evidence of their impact  review issue articles in the third decade of lq were cited     times per article on average compared to     for regular articles  this finding is also consistent with antonakis  bastardoz  liu  and schriesheim s   conclusion that articles published in review issues tend to be highly cited    as are quantitative  theory  and methods articles   most cited articles  following gardner et al  s   example  we compiled a list of the most highly cited articles of those published during lq s third decade    here  we report the total citations  citations per year  and the rank for each article  the most highly cited article is a lqyr methods review on causal claims    suggesting that scholars recognize and appreciate methods articles    even though there were not a large number of these published in lq during the last decade  this particular methods article has been highly impactful because it highlights endogeneity issues that negate the ability of authors to make causal inferences about focal re  lationships  but also introduces corrective actions for addressing  endogeneity issues to the leadership field    ranks first in the number of most highly cited articles    followed by                and      with the exception of      the last half of the decade is absent from this list  most likely because insufficient time has passed for citations of these articles to accumulate  with regards to the leadership theories reflected in highly cited articles    theories are present  transformational leadership dominates the most cited list with nine articles focused on its premises  authentic leadership is second with five articles  followed by leadership devel  opment    ethical leadership    and two articles each for destructive leadership  implicit leadership  leader member exchange    servant leadership  followership theory  and participative  shared leadership delegation and empowerment   institutional contributions and authorship teams  we investigated the composition and diversity of authorship teams from the perspective of gender  team size  affiliations  world regions  and how articles  authors  and authorships are distributed across world regions  in order to account for authors who publish multiple papers in lq  we define authorships as the number of papers on which a person is an author   regarding gender       of authors were male versus      fe  male       of authorships were male versus      female  thus  males are more likely to have published more than once versus females  we noticed that some leadership theories seem to be preferred pub  lication topics based on gender  for example       and      of the authorships on articles which focused on charismatic leadership and participative shared leadership delegation and empowerment were male  while             and      of the authorships on articles that focused on leadership development  leadership and diversity  and identity and identification processes  respectively  were female   author team size varied widely between one and ten authors  three  author teams were most common    followed by two  author teams    four author teams    five author teams    and single author papers    author teams of six to   authors accounted for    of papers  the author teams drew from one to

and four world regions were rare    articles with affiliations from europe   were the second most common after the united states    followed by asia    australia and new zealand    north america non us    middle east    and central south america    the percent of authors and authorships by geographic region were similar    so  while the united states was the largest contributor with respect to af  filiations  approximately    of the authors and authorships came from non us sources  further  while us based university of oklahoma and binghamton university   topped the list  there were   non us institutions in the top   in terms of contributions to articles    with erasmus university rotterdam placing third  these data  suggest that during the third decade  lq has expanded its international footprint to become a more global journal  finally  corporate con  sulting affiliations account for    of the authorships  the center for creative leadership leads in terms of number of authors    number of articles    and affiliations     as noted during the prior discussion of the distribution of disciplines represented among lq s editorial leadership  one of the primary com  ponents of lq s mission since its inception has been to publish articles from a wide array of disciplines  in their review of lq s first decade  lowe and gardner   noted that the journal had modest success in achieving this goal  as    of authors were affiliated with business schools and or management departments  with psychology a distant second with     gardner et al    concluded that progress toward this goal was achieved in lq s second decade  as the proportion of au  thors from non management business disciplines increased from    to     our findings suggest that this trend was reversed in lq s third decade  as roughly two thirds   of authorships were again af  filiated with management departments  and another      with psy  chology departments  leaving only      from other fields    however  greater diversity of disciplines is apparent for      where the proportion of psychology affiliated au  thorships dropped to       and the level of representation from the fields of economics    anthropology    and other fields   increased  thus  we echo lowe and gardner s initial conclusion that only modest success with regard to this element of lq s mission has been achieved over the past three decades  nonetheless  there is some preliminary evidence that the strategic decision of the current editor  john antonakis  to recruit aes with more diverse disciplinary back  grounds is attracting scholars from disciplines that have not historically been represented among contributing authors  it remains to be seen if this trend will be sustained and perhaps accelerated over the next decade   coder agreement  in an effort to ensure consistency in the coding of articles  the six  member author team developed a coding manual  each article was then coded by one of the authors using the codebook as a point of reference  in a further effort to promote coding consistency  the author team met regularly throughout the coding process to discuss and address any challenges uncertainties regarding the coding scheme and its applica  tion  following the coding of the   articles  interrater reliability was computed by having a different author independently code a subset of    of the articles  interrater reliability was computed for the three main coding categories of focal theory  article type  and study methods and analyses  note that the article type and focal theory were coded at the article level  whereas the study methods and analysis were coded at the study level  since some articles reported methods and results for multiple studies  the percentage agreement for the focal theory  a single coding item  was     for article type  the percentage agreement was    and the pairwise cohen s kappa was     with a range of          for study methods  the percentage agreement was    and cohen s kappa was     with a range of          each of these results is indicative of a very high level of rater agreement and hence reliability    with values of         characterized as near perfect agreement    following the computation of the interrater reliability statistics  all discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached   leadership theories  a

from the first author upon request   w l  gardner  et al  the leadership quarterly             third decade  it is useful to elaborate on the findings from the prior two decades provided in our introduction  lowe and gardner   found that neo charismatic leadership theories  which included transforma  tional leadership  were by far the most common focal theories   employed in lq articles during the journal s first decade  followed by contingency theories    multiple level approaches    and trait theories    however  a full quarter of the theories were classified as other approaches and encompassed leadership and diversity  cross  cultural leadership  and managerial work  moreover     of the arti  cles were classified as new directions  in lq s second decade  the focal leadership theories that lowe and gardner   categorized as new directions exploded to encompass a full      of the articles  with emerging theories such as ethical servant spiritual authentic leader  ship    the development and identification of leaders and lea  dership    and contextual influences on leadership   gaining attention  while neo charismatic   approaches remained pop  ular  the proportion of articles focused on these approaches declined  as it did for more traditional leadership theories such as trait theories    behavioral theories    and contingency theories    slightly more attention was devoted to multiple level approaches   in lq s second decade   an examination of table   reveals some interesting trends in terms of the relative prominence of theories represented in lq studies over the past decade  at the outset  it is important to recognize that the focal theory taxonomies used by lowe and gardner   and gardner et al    included   and   theories  respectively  in contrast  the meuser et al    taxonomy we employed includes   focal theories  hence  comparisons of the proportions of articles that adopted a given focal theory are smaller  simply because there are more focal theories  as such  our comparisons across decades focus on the relative propor  tions of articles using a focal theory  as opposed to the percentage  to facilitate such comparisons  we have sorted the focal theories from most to least commonly used and grouped them into clusters in the table   the first cluster reflects the most commonly used focal theories and includes nine that were invoked in more than    of the articles coded  as in lq s first decade  transformational leadership again emerged as the most commonly researched theory  serving as the focal theory in      of the articles  note that in their   review  gardner and colleagues did not distinguish between transformational and charismatic leadership  as both were coded as neo charismatic theories  applying the more fine grained meuser et al    taxonomy  however  it becomes apparent that  popularity of these theories has followed different trajectories  as charis  matic leadership only served as the focal theory in      of the articles  thus  despite pointed criticisms    transformational leadership theory remains popular  in contrast  despite antonakis  bastardoz  jacquart  and shamir s   efforts to strengthen charismatic leadership theory and a special issue devoted to the topic    the proportion of articles focused on char  isma has declined  nonetheless  we speculate that the refined definition and recommendations for enhancing the rigor of charismatic leadership research advanced by antonakis et al    may stimulate renewed in  terest in the topic in the next decade   interestingly  the coding category of  none  tied with transformational leadership as the most commonly selected category at       this indicates that many articles published in lq s third decade lacked a focal theory  reasons why this category may have been applicable include  a  the in  clusion of multiple but no dominant leadership theory    b  a focus on methods rather than theory  and c  a focal theory that reflects a new conceptual perspective that could not be classified using the meuser et al    taxonomy  the former case is consistent with meuser and colleagues  conclusion that many leadership articles draw upon and integrate multiple leadership theories  in the latter case  the  none  category essentially reflects the new directions category employed in the prior two reviews  thus  even with a taxonomy of   leadership theories  new theories emerged over the last decade that defied classification  this finding documents the theoretical vigor of the field  while simultaneously raising concerns about unnecessary construct pro  liferation     the next most common focal theory was leadership development at       the inclusion of a special issue devoted to leadership develop  ment   early in the decade clearly contributed to the relatively high proportion of articles with the publication of ar  ticles in subsequent years demonstrating continued interest in the topic  we consider this to be a very positive development as insufficient at  tention has been devoted to this critical topic in the past  leader  member exchange   theory emerged as the third most common focal theory    and interest in this topic remained strong throughout the decade  lq s third decade also saw a resurgence in at  tention to trait   approaches  as this constituted the fourth most common focal theory    perhaps this resurgence is  at least in part  the result of work by judge and colleagues           judge  colbert    ilies     judge  piccolo    kosalka     which demonstrated that prior reviews were misinterpreted as dismissing the utility of the trait approach    this dismissal is now regarded as premature as traits were shown to have considerable power in predicting leadership emergence and effectiveness  prominent theories that were previously coded by lowe and gardner   and gardner et al    as other approaches or new directions that gained increased attention in lq s third decade include leadership and diversity    emotions and leadership    strategic leadership    and destructive leadership    which includes abusive su  pervision  it is noteworthy that dinh et al    reported similar findings with respect to the prominent and emerging theories they identified in their review of the leadership literature published in top management journals between   and     the next set of focal leadership theories includes   that were found in less than    but more than    of the articles coded  note that ethical    authentic    and servant   leadership first emerged as focal theories in the gardner et al    review  where they were  grouped together with spiritual leadership to account for      of the focal theories  as a set  it is clear that these theories garnered increased attention over the past decade  additionally  given that these theories differ in their assumptions and posited processes  the separation of these theories into distinct categories proved to be useful  both for conceptual reasons and to better track their relative influence  the rise of these theories is consistent with trends identified by dinh et al     which suggests that the field of leadership and lq in particular continues to be open to new and maturing perspectives  along with empirical tests of theories that emerged during the prior two decades  additional focal theories that were labeled as other approaches and new directions in prior reviews that fall into this cluster include lea  dership in teams    contextual complexity adaptive approaches    power influence politics    public leadership    and cross cultural leadership    interest in these topics has remained relatively steady over the past two decades  finally  some focal theories   gained recognition as distinct

leadership quarterly             dominant   has waned  the third cluster of theories includes   that were found in fewer  than    but more than    of the studies coded  this cluster includes a mixture of theories from relatively young areas of inquiry    as well as others that are more mature     the final cluster of theories identifies nine theories that are included in our taxonomy but were not indicated as the focal theory in any ar  ticle published in lq in the most recent decade  these include a mixture of mature theories    and several that are relatively narrow in focus    while a resurgence of interest in some of the mature approaches is certainly possible  as has been the case for the trait ap  proach  we think it is more likely that the decades long decline in at  tention to these approaches   will continue  while the trends for the ascending approaches   will be sus  tained  perhaps some of the more narrowly focused theories are can  didates for integration with more general leadership theories  such as contextual complexity adaptive approaches to leadership   quantitative techniques and designs  a summary of the types of research designs used in quantitative studies is presented in table    as with prior decade reviews  we found that field surveys are still favored when collecting primary data with      of studies in the present decade employing this technique  one potential concern is the use of convenience samples    which accounted for the sample in      of the   quantitative studies  the vast majority of which involved surveys  laboratory experiments showed a marked increase in usage  ranking second   overall  only    of quantitative studies used experimental designs in the prior decade  consistent with prior decade reviews  we find experience sampling  field experiments  quasi experiments  field surveys with secondary data  and computer simulations to be employed infrequently  clearly  given the strengths of some of these designs  such as quasi experimental research    opportunities remain to better capitalize on a wider range of research designs to generate novel and more rigorous findings   quantitative analytical techniques  a summary of the analytical statistical techniques employed in quantitative studies is provided in table    the most common statis  tical analyses performed in quantitative studies were     linear regres  sion       analysis of variance  including both anova  ancova  and manova mancova       structural equation modeling   and path analysis    and    multi level analytical techni  ques    given the inherently multi level nature of leadership phe  nomena    it is somewhat surprising that multi level analytical techniques were not used more often  nonetheless  they were used more often than was the case in the prior decade    so there is evidence of increasing efforts to evaluate multi  level leadership relationships  another favorable trend involves the increased use of non parametric techniques   over the prior decade    as such methods have notable advantages over traditional null hypothesis testing   ta  bl e    r es  ea rc  h de  si gn  s   y ea  r v  ol c  om pu  te

                                                                                                                                                        to ta  l                                  to ta  l                                                                                       w l  gardner  et al  the leadership quarterly             incorporated data from     participants and   studies  studies employing self report data   accounted for      of studies  while      captured data about supervisors from followers and      capture data from leaders about followers  what our sample data do not reveal is the proportion of studies that collected data from dyads    however  given the relatively small proportion of data collected by one half of the potential dyad leaders we suspect that such cases of matching data where both parties rate the same variable   continue to be rela  tively rare  as found in prior reviews    this supports concerns that leadership research is not adequately capturing the dyadic and reciprocal nature of the re  lationship  likewise  researchers may not be adequately addressing the context within which leadership occurs  as team   and organiza  tion   data constitutes a small fraction of the data published in lq between   and    nearly absent are reports from peers  fa  milies  and customers outside sources  representing an opportunity for expanding both theory and research designs  to further consider the concern that researchers may not be adequately addressing the context of leadership  we coded for the country from which study samples were drawn    most data were sampled from the united states   followed by europe   with the netherlands   being the largest contributor  and asia    with china   being the largest contributor  some data were truly multi na  tional    sample location was not reported in      of the em  pirical articles   measure information  we also examined measures employed in lq empirical studies    an examination of this table reveals that      studies that collected data using survey measures employed existing measures  while      used modified measures  and      created new mea  sures  one point of concern we encountered involves these newly cre  ated measures  where only   of the   studies   employed standard scale development practices    this suggests a gap between best and actual practices in lea  dership research  we also noted reliability information was missing in some studies    researchers publishing in lq rarely employed unobtrusive   and biometric measures    con  tinuing a trend found in the earlier lq reviews  thus  there remains an opportunity for novel research designs to explore leadership phe  nomena  we encountered few instances of the use of difference scores  which are generally seen as poor practice    regarding the timing of data collection  cross sectional designs remain a staple of recent research    cross sectional data collection with a time lag between independent and outcome variables ranks second    true longitudinal research characterized by repeated measurement to assess change is still relatively rare     qualitative techniques  few studies during lq s third decade employed qualitative techni  ques    qualitative studies were most common in      followed by      and   and      with the other years accounting for less than    of the qualitative studies individually and      together  case studies were the most common form of qualitative en  quiry    followed by grounded theory    narrative    phenomenological    and ethno  graphic   approaches  given the complexity of the leadership phenomenon  the dearth of studies that employ these context rich ap  proaches represents an opportunity for future research  with quanti  tative inquiry alone  there is a risk of ignoring elements that are re  quired for explaining relationships  as qualitative approaches can enhance understanding of the context of leadership relationships as well as the nature of the relationships themselves  thus generating more meaningful explanations     strengths and limitations  one limitation of our design is the subjective   nature of human coding  this limitation is mitigated somewhat by a strength of our design where we entered objective data into a database form  which reduces errors versus entering data into a ms excel file  the very high degree of interrater agreement also suggests that the use of a coding manual and the evolution   of the coding manual as we learned from the coding process further reduced the chance of error  indeed  a strength over prior decade reviews is the use of an expanded coding scheme  though this introduces the weakness of making direct comparisons between decade reviews more difficult  we believe that as the field evolves  the coding scheme used to describe the field must also expand  when entering author gender  we made our decision based on the first name of the author with further exploration using internet images  it is possible that proquest has errors in this field  our internet search was faulty  or that we intuited wrongly for some authors  we drew our citation information from scopus on december       it is possible that scopus has errors  this also does not account for the full citation record of    which was not possible due to publication deadlines  our author team includes early  mid  and later stage scholars allowing for the strength of a variety of viewpoints  one caveat to the reader  this review is by design and intent restricted to lq s third decade only  as such  trends in the study of leadership that are not represented or proportionally represented in lq publications between   and   are not captured in the present review   future directions  in

quarterly             gardner   clearly delineated eight content directions for future research  these were derived from their content analysis of lq pub  lications  interviews with the founding editors  and personal insights  in their review of lq s second decade of publications  gardner et al    briefly revisited these recommended content directions to see how much progress had been made in pursuing them  after doing so  however  they noted the difficulty of preparing a similar set of content  oriented directions for future leadership research  given the  explosion of leadership theories and novelty of approaches to studying leadership that have emerged in the most recent decade  and hence  handicapping a short list of future topics is more speculative than at any time in recent decades     instead  gardner et al    chose to  identify a few study design and methodological aspects that will move the science of the field forward in whatever content domains are re  vealed to be most in favor over the next decade    for our review of lq s third decade  it is informative to revisit the content and methodological recommendations offered in past lq re  views as a prelude for our discussion of future research directions  toward that end  we provide a summary of lowe and gardner s   recommended content directions in table    along with gardner et al  s   assessment of the extent that they were realized in lq s second decade  and our own assessment of the degree to which they were addressed in lq s third decade  in addition  we provide a summary of gardner et al  s   methodological recommendations in table    and include our evaluation of the extent to which these re  commendations have been adopted in lq s third decade  because we found that the content and methodological recommendations offered in the prior reviews remain timely  we base our suggestions for future research on the progress that has been made regarding their suggestions while identifying opportunities for further advancements   table   lq  review recommendations revisited in lq  and lq  reviews   lq  future directions identified lq  future directions revisited in lq   lq  future

still receiving considerable attention as one of the most common focal leadership theories  and also among the most cited articles   table   lq  review recommendations revisited   lq  future directions identified lq  future directions revisited in lq   expand set of measures the number of measures employed has definitely expanded with the introduction of several new leadership scales  but  has the expansion come at the cost of rigor  many articles modified scales and new measures failed to employ standard scale development and validation processes   studies within studies    we have seen an increase in studies within studies  particularly in the most recent full year of lq articles     with an average of     studies per article  as opposed to a range from     to     in prior years  the extent to which this trend extends into future years merits attention   interdisciplinary teams though the second decade of lq made progress toward a greater diversity of author disciplines  the third decade saw a reversion with over two thirds of contributing authors being affiliated with management departments and over    being affiliated with management or psychology departments  however  perhaps due to the recent increased diversity among the ae team and editorial review board  there is preliminary evidence in the final years of the decade that support an increased representation of authors from other fields  this trend and whether it is sustained should continue to be monitored over the next decade   multi level phenomena the adoption of multi level techniques and examinations continued to increase in lq s third decade  nonetheless  greater recognition of the multi level nature of leadership phenomena is warranted  highlighting a need for more multi level studies   controlled experiments empirical studies in lq s third decade included    that employed lab experiments  as compared to only    in the previous decade  this suggests that authors are responding to calls for more experimental designs  and particularly realistic experiments      alternative methodologies not enough has been done here  over half of the lq studies of the last decade employed one of two designs  field surveys and lab experiments  there is definitely room for a greater variety of research designs     test competing models while we did not explicitly code the extent to which lq studies tested competing models  our impression from coding is that such tests were infrequent   cognition studies greater attention is apparent from the special issue on leader cognition and neuroscience    as well as an increase in the occurrence of leader and follower cognitions as a focal leadership theory   technology   not enough work has been done to expand the use of technology to study leadership  relatively few studies employed unobtrusive biometric measures  this represents an area of opportunity as evolving technology provides ever expanding methods for studying leadership   w l  gardner  et al  the leadership quarterly             revisiting lowe and gardner s   content direction recommendations  lowe and gardner s   recommended content directions for future leadership research called for increased attention to the topics of strategic leadership  levels of analysis  leadership development and leadership systems  leadership context  women as leaders  international leadership  technology    and transformational  charismatic leadership    gardner et al    concluded that the most attention was devoted to exploring levels of analysis is  sues and transformational charismatic leadership  while our third decade review likewise revealed greater recognition and focus on studying leadership as a multi level phenomenon as evidenced by the increased use of multi level analytical techniques  we believe that heightened consideration of this fundamental quality of leadership   is still needed  as for theory and research into transformational and charismatic leadership  the former continues to garner high levels of attention  though not as much as in prior dec  ades on a proportional basis  while the latter has experienced a more precipitous decline in attention  given recent critiques and reorienta  tions of research into transformational   and charismatic   leadership  as well as an lq special issue   focused on novel and rigorous approaches toward studying the latter topic  we are optimistic that research into these forms of leadership will continue  but in a more productive and theoretically grounded manner that yields more meaningful findings and implications for leadership practice  we also note that alternative forms of inquiry such as qualitative methods might prove useful in enhancing understanding about the context of charis  matic leadership events as well as meaningful explanations about the events themselves   with regards to strategic leadership  gardner et al    noted that this topic gained considerable interest during lq s second decade  as apparent from special issues on strategic leadership that appeared both within and outside lq    lq s third decade saw a further increase in attention to strategic leadership  as it was the eighth most common focal theory  and a special issue was devoted to the topic    nevertheless  given the importance of strategic leadership to key organizational outcomes including financial perfor  mance  innovation  corporate social responsibility  and sustainability    we strongly re  commend that even more theoretical and empirical attention should be devoted to this topic   gardner et al    also observed an uptick in attention to con  textual influences on leadership   and the related topic of com  plexity perspectives of leadership    particularly in the latter half of lq s second decade  however  we observed only modest interest in contextual complexity adaptive leadership perspectives  as these served as the focal theory in only      of the articles published in lq s third decade  we recommend that increased attention be devoted to studying the influence of context on leadership    we consider complexity   and adaptive leadership   theories to be well suited for studying the role of context in leadership processes  as mentioned above  qualitative methodologies may also be beneficial in advancing knowledge about leadership con  text   as for their remaining content directions for leadership research  gardner et al    stated that  from their  viewpoint there was  relative to the need  a disappointing amount of attention paid to females as leaders  international leadership  leadership systems  and the impact of technology on leadership   for two of these topical areas international leadership and the impact of technology on lea  dership such disappointment continues  as these topics were infre  quently examined in lq s third decade  given the influence of culture  on leadership as documented by the globe study    greater attention to the manifestation and effectiveness of leadership within an international arena is clearly needed  similarly  as more and more organizations embrace virtual teams   and other forms of technology that facilitates geographically distributed decision making or management  the importance of e leadership   expands  warranting greater attention to the topic   the good news is that the other two content topics recommended by gardner et al    have received an upswing in research attention  specifically  considerable attention has been devoted to leadership development in lq s third decade  as this served as the second most common focal theory   for articles published in the most recent decade  indeed  two special issues   and another forthcoming   indicate current and continuing research interest in this domain  similarly  an increase in attention focused on leadership and diversi  ty the vast majority of which examines gender effects is apparent from the rise in the number of articles published from      in lq s second decade to      in the third decade  this rise was  in part  aided by a special issue devoted to gender and leadership    while we find these trends encouraging  we recommend that greater attention be devoted to the study of leadership systems  as re  commended by lowe and gardner    as well as other forms of diversity     revisiting gardner et al  s   methodological recommendations  a summary of gardner et al  s   methodological re  commendations is provided in table    the first involved a move away from the field s reliance on a narrow set of retrospective survey mea  sures  e g   the multifactor leadership questionnaire   or the lmx      as the definition of leadership by expanding the use of real time measurement   and more direct measures of leadership      our review of lq s third decade revealed that retrospective surveys continue to be the dominant means of measuring leadership phe  nomena  as      of quantitative studies used such measures  which is an increase to that found in the prior decade    adding to concerns about this methodology are our findings that most of the studies that employed surveys also used convenience samples  raising concerns about the representativeness of the findings  additionally  we found that it was common practice to introduce new survey measures  or modify existing survey measures  without following best practices for scale development and validation    here  it is noteworthy the current editor of lq  john antonakis    pre  dicted that    years from now  the typical leadership design using ques  tionnaire measures of leadership style to predict outcomes  whether objective or not  will be used less and less and there will be more of a focus on objectively measured behavior  real time and archival  at this time overall the field in general does not yet fully recognize or appreciate that typical questionnaire type designs do not have much to offer in terms of policy implications   while alternative measures  such as content analysis    diary studies  and event sampling   continue to be under utilized  new measures have been introduced to the field that may foreshadow this predicted replacement of survey based research  these include implicit measures    facial expression  w l  gardner  et al  the leadership quarterly             coding    biosensor measures    com  puter assisted textual analysis    and social network measures    given the availability and promise of such measures  the time is ripe for researchers to heed this call and wean themselves from their overreliance on retrospective surveys  we also expect that the editorial board and the journal s leadership would welcome methodological pieces that introduce why and how these types of novel approaches could advance leadership research   a second methodological recommendation advanced by gardner et al    involves conducting more research using multiple studies    that richly and methodologically demonstrate how a leadership phenomenon unfolds   our findings re  vealed progress in reaching this goal during lq s third decade  parti  cularly during    for which the average was     studies for every lq article published  we are optimistic that this trend will continue  as reviewers and editors alike call for greater multi study research to more fully flesh out leadership processes and rule out competing explanations for the relationships identified  this does not mean that we believe articles that answer  big  questions are not called for  instead  we be  lieve that multi study work can answer big questions a piece at a time  yielding a stronger demonstration   of the leadership phenomenon of interest   a third recommendation offered by gardner et al    called for  research teams combining psychologists  sociologists  an  thropologists  and cognitive scientists who can bring multiple per  spectives and methodologies to the formation of research questions and tests of hypotheses   in this review we coded author discipline  with the results summarized in table    the findings revealed that roughly two  thirds of authors are affiliated with management departments  and      with psychology departments  leaving only    for other dis  ciplines  while we did not code for interdisciplinary teams per se  it is clear that gardner and colleagues  call for such teams has not been answered  given the over representation of management and psy  chology faculty among lq authors  on the one hand  given the in  creasing diversification of lq s editorial leadership and review board  it would not be surprising to find that some of these scholars partner to investigate leadership phenomena from a multi disciplinary perspective in the future  or that authors from diverse disciplines respond to the signal sent by lq s increasingly diverse disciplinary editorial leadership and editorial board that such research would be welcome  on the other hand  given well entrenched barriers that exist to discourage inter  disciplinary and transdisciplinary research    we also would not be surprised if it remains relatively rare  regardless of the level of interdisciplinary leadership research conducted  we echo gardner et al  s   call for more interdisciplinary teams to produce novel perspectives and approaches to studying leadership   gardner et al  s   fourth recommendation called for  the foci of cross level studies to move toward understanding how leadership is enacted and evaluated at different levels simultaneously   indeed  batistič  černe  and vogel   found that the leadership field remains fragmented  with only certain leadership models   cur  rently employing a levels of analysis approach for both their leadership conceptualizations and associated outcomes    accordingly  while we have witnessed a continuing increase in multi  level research in our review  as our prior discussion of lowe and gardner s   suggestions indicated  we believe it is time for the field to take gardner et al  s   recommendation to  treat cross  level understanding of the phenomena as foreground and thereby make partialing the statistical variance background when our goal is to under  stand the effects of leaders and leadership at different levels   this charge to the field is further bolstered by a number of multi level approach recommendations made more recently in batistič et al      the fifth recommendation made by gardner et al    calls for greater use of controlled experiments to tease out causal relationships among the antecedents and consequences of leadership  as noted in our discussion of research methods  lq s third decade has been character  ized by more extensive use of experimental methods  as the proportion of studies that employed such methods rose substantially in lq s third decade relative to the prior two  perhaps this increase is in partial re  sponse to antonakis et al  s   call at the beginning of the decade for more experimental research to address pervasive endogeneity con  cerns that have plagued the leadership field  as well as the social sci  ences in general  nonetheless  we observed little use of the types of quasi experimental research antonakis et al  advocated  given the di  versity and the utility of quasi experimental studies for ascertaining causal relations    we echo the calls of anto  nakis and others   for greater usage of this powerful methodology   the sixth recommendation made by gardner et al    called for the use of alternative methodologies from other fields of study  such as behavioral economics  narrative analytical techniques developed by sociologists  and computer simulations pioneered by psychologists  as we noted in our discussion of measures  the field of leadership has in  creasingly borrowed from other disciplines to introduce more novel approaches to studying leadership phenomena    in addition  the appointment of aes from a wider array of dis  ciplines including economics  evolutionary psychology  and political science  as well the publication of special issues that demonstrate the utility of methods from the fields of biology    neu  roscience   and economics   for studying leadership  suggests that the field is poised to embrace a host of methods from other disciplines   the seventh recommendation advanced by gardner et al    involved a call to test competing models through data analysis  while our coding provides little insight into the extent to which this occurred  our impression from reading the   articles published during lq s third decade is that such comparisons remain rare  nonetheless  recent meta analyses by banks  mccauley  gardner  and guler   and hoch  bommer  dulebohn  and wu   that compared the predictive utility of authentic  ethical  servant  and transformational leadership demonstrate the value of such comparative analyses  we encourage leadership researchers to follow these examples to conduct more ex  tensive comparisons of leadership theories to assess their predictive power and their boundary conditions   gardner et al  s   eighth recommendation is to devote greater attention to the cognitive aspects of leaders and leadership  it appears that progress has been made in this regard  as leader and follower cognitions  implicit leadership theories  identity and identification processes  social identity theory  and information processing and deci  sion making all focal theories that involve cognitive pro  cesses combined to account for      of focal theories  additionally  three special issues were dedicated to leadership and cognition    despite such progress  the fundamental im  portance of leader and follower cognitions to the perception  emer  gence  and enactment of leadership highlights the need for continuing research in this domain   finally  gardner et al    recommended that researchers draw more extensively on technology to generate new insights into leader  ship phenomena  as previously noted  our findings suggest that while retrospective surveys continue to dominate as measures of leadership  new applications of technology are gaining traction that promise to expand our methodological tool chest including measures of facial ex  pressions    bio  sensors    implicit measures    computer assisted textual analysis    and social network measures     w l  gardner  et al  the leadership quarterly             editor interviews  in addition to revisiting the content and methodological re  commendations from prior reviews  we also interviewed  for purposes of this manuscript  mike mumford  leanne atwater  and john antonakis  each of whom served as editor in chief during some portion of the leadership quarterly s third decade  the editor interviews re  inforced several of the themes discussed previously and also introduced new topics  while a full discussion of the rich insights provided is be  yond the scope of this manuscript  we briefly highlight ten themes   one theme raised by the editors involved the need to pay more attention to context   as a boundary condi  tion on our theories rather than searching for a single moderated mediation model that can explain it all  a second theme was the need to continue to reduce an overreliance on survey research utilizing mea  sures that are underspecified for the richness of the phenomenon they seek to measure  a third theme  related to the preceding point  is the need to broaden the methods employed including increased usage of simulations  robust experimental designs  and qualitative research methods  a fourth theme was a general concern about construct pro  liferation in the field  the increase in construct proliferation was per  ceived to be at least  in part  driven by journals insisting on new the  oretical development as normative  in contrast to pushing for the development of new theory  a general sentiment was that devoting si  milar effort to the development of better measurement of the constructs currently in place  and more robust research designs to tease out the nuances and boundary conditions of existing theories  would better serve the field at this juncture  a fifth theme involved a recognition that more needs to be done to understand how leadership demands are si  milar  and different  at upper middle and upper echelons of the orga  nization  the editors noted that our current knowledge  which has largely been obtained from middle level managers and lower level su  pervisors  is better suited to informing undergraduates and other early career workers  related to this concern is that the reporting of leader  ship research findings generally ignores both responsibility level in the organization and the context in which leadership is practiced  this challenge is exacerbated by one size fits all theories that provide rela  tively little guidance on the boundary conditions across contexts and responsibility levels   a sixth theme was the need to better understand the implications of increasingly non western samples in leadership research explored pre  dominately through the lens of theory developed in first world  anglo  centric organizations  while the general feeling is that construct pro  liferation and consistent pushes for new theoretical development may not have served the field well  the need for theory development in non  western settings or from non western lenses may be a needed exception  a seventh theme was the need to better integrate disciplinary per  spectives on leadership  for example  psychology researchers typically frame leadership as an outcome variable  whereas organizational be  havior researchers typically frame leadership as a predictor variable  an eighth theme was the need to better understand how technology  especially the role of social media and the potential to be constantly connected  is challenging how we define leadership and what is ex  pected from leaders  the use of artificial intelligence and deep learning will also be on the uptake  challenging both our understanding of lea  dership and redefining the challenges leaders face  a ninth theme was to provide more attention to how changing social norms influence leadership challenges  as a recent example  the   metoo  movement both raised social awareness and challenged social norms of often quietly condoned behavior  at the same time the heightened attention gave rise to new forms of backlash in cross gender relationships  thus  gender and gendered dynamics specifically  and diversity in general  will continue to require more attention than the field has generally afforded the topics  finally  a tenth theme reflected a need to better link effective leadership to organizational outcomes  leadership is generally posited as one method for improving organizational level performance   yet most leadership research focuses on individual level   per  formance or the relationship of leader behavior on group    level performance  as a field  we have little evidence that these individual  and group level outcomes cumulatively increase organizational per  formance  thus  developing theories and measures of how leadership systems impact the performance of organizational systems remains a challenge for the field   conclusion  since its founding in    the leadership quarterly has provided three decades of leadership for theory and research into the study and practice of leadership phenomena  while our review of the content and methodological recommendations offered in the reviews of lq s first and second decades revealed areas where only limited progress had been made  it also revealed many encouraging developments  based on our assessment of lq s third decade of publications  we conclude that it is fulfilling its mission to advance  our understanding of leadership as a phenomenon  how to study it  as well as its practical implications  while studying  leaders from all walks of social life  and publishing  scholarly research  theory  and developmental application from di  verse fields of inquiry about leadership     we also find that lq s record of publishing rigorous and innovative research during its first three decades provides a basis for optimism that the journal  and the field  will continue to expand our knowledge of leaders and leadership into new frontiers  we look forward  with optimistic anticipation  to the story lq s fourth decade will tell about the evolution and study of leadership   references  antonakis  j     editorial  the future of the leadership quarterly  the leadership quarterly           antonakis  j     on doing better

organizations  kaylene j  mcclanahan kellogg school of management  northwestern university  united states of america  a b s t r a c t  research from multiple fields suggests that throughout human history  leaders ascended the hierarchy through one of two strategies dominance   or prestige    the dual strategies theory of social rank suggests that these two strategies are still inherent in human psychology  and that consideration of dominance and prestige can help explain hierarchy and leadership in modern social groups  thus far  research on dual strategies theory has developed without significant cross fertilization from the literature on leadership within organizational settings  in this review  i provide the first examination of dual strategies theory within the context of broader leadership research  highlighting a  the unique contributions of dual strategies theory  b  current workforce trends that make dual strategies theory particularly applicable to modern organizations  and c  key limitations of dual strategies theory that could be addressed by integrating leadership theory   in the last two decades  evolutionary social psychologists have proposed a new framework for classifying and thinking about in  dividuals  approaches to social hierarchy  this framework the dual  strategies theory of social rank suggests that attempts to gain and maintain positions of high social rank can be categorized as one of two strategies  dominance or prestige    a dominant style is characterized by the use of force or coercion to claim social power  in contrast  a prestige based approach typically involves de  monstrating valued traits such as competence and generosity so others follow the leader of their own volition  this theory is gaining traction in social and evolutionary psychology  as evidenced by the number of papers in this area published in top psychology journals over the past decade     despite asking similar questions  research on dual strategies theory has thus far developed without significant cross fertilization from the larger body of research on leadership in organizations  in the following  i address the divide between these two literatures by providing the first examination of the dual strategies theory of social rank within the context of broader leadership theory  the aim of this review is to in  troduce dual strategies theory to leadership researchers who may be unfamiliar with it  clarify the unique contributions of the dual strate  gies theory of social rank  and describe the potential benefits of cross  fertilization from these two literatures  finally  i argue that although dual strategies theory has not been extensively studied in  organizational settings  it is a particularly useful theory for under  standing many modern employment contexts   in order to situate the dual strategies theory of social rank within the context of the broader leadership theory and research  i first define social rank  power  status  and leadership  next  i briefly introduce the dual strategies theory of social rank  including the intellectual tradi  tions that gave birth to the theory  with this introduction complete  i take three steps to position this theory within the context of the orga  nizational behavior literature on leadership  first  i describe a few of the most prominent leadership theories and compare and contrast these theories with dual strategies theory  second  i describe the unique focus and contributions of dual strategies theory relative to organizational behavior literature on leadership and argue that this theory offers un  ique explanatory value that is increasingly pertinent to the modern workforce  third  to demonstrate how principles from the broader re  search on literature can provide fertile theoretical ground for future research within dual strategies theory  i take a few select concepts from the literature on leadership and describe how they can be applied to dual strategies theory to generate and answer important empirical questions   defining key terms  definitions of leadership  social rank  power  and status are plen  tiful  varied  and seldom agreed upon    given that this review draws from lit  erature in organizational behavior  social psychology  and evolutionary anthropology  all of whom use these terms differently  defining each of    received   november    received in revised form   august    accepted   september    e mail address     the leadership quarterly        available online   october        ©   elsevier inc  all rights reserved   t                  these key terms is a crucial first step in exploring how these two bodies of literature relate to each other   social rank  the concept of social rank is central to dual strategies theory and is defined as one s position within a hierarchy  where hierarchy is a  rank order of individuals or groups on a valued social dimension     a person with high social rank is a person with a position near the top of the hierarchy   there are a few points worth clarifying about this conception of social rank  first  a person s social rank is relative  it depends on their immediate reference group  for example  in formal organizational hierarchies  many employees serve as both managers and sub  ordinates a manager might be in a position of high social rank when interfacing with her subordinates  but might have average or even low social rank when interacting with other managers in firm  second  hierarchies can be either formal or informal  a job title conveys an in  dividual s position within the organization s formal hierarchy  but cer  tain individuals might also be informally deferred to more than others with the same job title  giving them a higher position within the in  formal hierarchy  similarly  even in social groups where there is no formal hierarchy for example  a book club informal hierarchies often emerge  a book club member who makes insightful contributions to the discussion and has an outsized influence on book selection might be considered to have high social rank despite his her lack of formal title  third  within a given social group  multiple hierarchies can  and generally do  exist    in other words  in  dividuals may be ranked on different dimensions  for example  one member of a work team might be considered a leader in technical ex  pertise  while another is considered a leader in client engagement  social rank can refer to one s location on one of these specific dimen  sions or the aggregate of all possible hierarchies  finally  hierarchies can be characterized by power or status    a distinction described in more detail below   power and status theory and empirical research suggest that power and status re   present distinct types of social rank and therefore are related but dis  tinct constructs    this distinction is im  portant to understanding dual strategies theory     power is the asymmetric control of valued resources in social re  lationships    a key feature of power is the asymmetry between group mem  bers  because the powerful control important resources  group members with less power are dependent upon them    in contrast  the powerful remain less dependent on others to get what they want  additionally  individuals can hold power by either controlling resources that are desirable   or that are undesirable    both of these reflect the asymmetric dependence and resource control that characterize power based hierarchies   in contrast to the control focus of power  status refers to  the re  spect  admiration  and voluntary deference an individual is afforded by others     crucially  status is in the eye of the perceivers  one cannot  seize  status the way one could  seize  power  as it is only granted by other members of the group    some organizational behavior research designates status as formal positions of power and esteem as the ad  miration and respect of others    but this is in  consistent with how the term  status  is used in social psychology    rather  research on social rank defines status as to  something closer to what these researchers would call  esteem   the distinction between power and status is important because  there is significant evidence that power and status are conferred sepa  rately    that power and status hierarchies function differently    and that the experience of having power has fun  damentally different psychological and behavioral consequences than having status    this distinction is also important to dual strategies theory  as several researchers have linked dominance with power and prestige with status    nevertheless  power and status frequently co  occur    unless specified  the term  social rank  is agnostic to the type of hierarchy  a person with high social rank can have power  status  or both   leadership  while definitions of leadership are plentiful    one consistently agreed upon theme is that leadership represents a complex  multi faceted group process by which an individual influences the group toward their goals    it is important to note that leadership does not refer to a position of high social rank  an individual with high social rank may be in a position to lead others  but that does not necessarily mean he or she will do so     dual strategies   the dual strategies theory of social rank focuses on the psycholo   gical and behavioral strategies that individuals employ to attain and maintain a position of high social rank  as well as the implications of these strategies for the group  in this way  the theory focuses on ap  proaches to hierarchy  and not necessarily the complex  multifaceted  and reciprocal processes of leadership  for this reason  dominance and prestige are not leadership styles  but rather reflect strategies by which individuals attempt to gain and maintain positions of social rank  some might assume from the word  strategy  that these behaviors are in  tentional  premediated  and or machiavellian  but this is not necessa  rily the case  individuals might engage in either of these strategies without even consciously considering their position within the hier  archy   although dual strategies theory is not a theory of leadership per se  understanding how social hierarchies are formed  maintained  or dis  rupted is an important component of understanding leadership in or  ganizations  thus  dual strategies theory can be used in conjunction with extant leadership theories to better explain leadership  follower  ship  and hierarchies in modern organizations or social groups broadly    additionally  many phe  nomena investigated by leadership researchers   are squarely within the domain of dual strategies theory  because of this  an integration of leadership research and dual strategies theory is likely to enrich both lines of research and prevent unnecessary duplication of research efforts   finally  although  leadership  refers to a complex  multiparty pro  cess  in the social psychological and anthropological research on hier  archy  it is typical to use the word  leader  to mean a person with high social rank  throughout this paper  i use the term leader to this effect     k j  mcclanahan the leadership quarterly             introduction to the dual strategies theory of social rank  the dual strategies theory of social rank is a theoretical perspective on hierarchy based in evolutionary psychology and anthropology    evolutionary psychology is a scientific line of inquiry that suggests that human psychology is   a reflection of our ancestral history    one key tenet of evo  lutionary psychology is that a comprehensive understanding of human psychology requires an investigation into the conditions and selection pressures to which humans evolved  by understanding the social en  vironments to which our brains adapted  we gain additional insights into human psychology and behavior  an evolutionary approach to hierarchy and leadership specifically means considering the selective pressures and adaptive problems solved by groups and leaders during human evolution  thus  insights into modern hierarchies can be gained by considering the groups and hierarchies of the human environment of evolutionary adaptedness  or eea   the human eea refers to the conditions to which we are humans evolved  while it is impossible to pinpoint a singular environment or time period that could reflect the complexity of human evolution  the eea represents the  composite of environment properties    that were present when humans evolved to their current form  it is hypothesized that most uniquely human traits evolved during the pleistocene era  which spanned from approximately     million years ago to approximately     years ago    during this time period  human social groups were quite dif  ferent from our modern context they tended to be small  kin based  and relatively egalitarian    hierarchy tended to be informal  domain specific  and marked by constant shifts    an investigation into these groups  as well as human selection pressures and ancestral environments that evoked them  provides a variety of fascinating questions and potential insights for leadership research     the dual strategies theory of social rank  however  focuses on one interesting dichotomy that has been noted by the ethologists  biologists  and evolutionary anthropologists who study these groups  specifically  they noted that   leaders sometimes engage in dominant behaviors that often benefit themselves at the expense of the group  and sometimes provide information  and skill based services that benefit both them  selves and the group     dual strategies theory suggests that this dichotomy between the use of force at the expense of the group   and the use of knowledge and skill to benefit the group   is at the core to understanding how individuals attain and maintain po  sitions of influence in social groups   dominance  hierarchies characterized by dominance typically feature in  dividuals who try to force and manipulate their way to positions at the top of the hierarchy    the dominance approach is  characterized by intimidation  coercion  and manipulation of group resources  dominant individuals are primarily interested in acquiring and retaining positions of power    and often prioritize this interest above the interests of the group    additionally  dominant leaders  preoccupation with their own standing within the group means they tend to be hyper vigilant to other group members who might pose a threat to their aspirations of power    dominant leaders are also more likely to subjugate their group members in order to in  crease the power differential between them and their followers  in other words  dominance is a hierarchy enhancing strategy     why might individuals allow a dominant individual to lead the group despite his her selfish behavior  scholars have identified at least four reasons why dominance hierarchies might emerge  first  a dom  inance hierarchy can prevent constant conflict over resources  a widely known and accepted pecking order provides clear rules and expecta  tions for how resources will be distributed among group members    this can prevent constant in fighting every time group resources need to be distributed  while being at the bottom of a dom  inance hierarchy may bear some cost  it can provide benefits to the group as a whole by preventing chaos   second  dominance can provide increased coordination among group members  making dominance particularly valuable in situations in which a high degree of coordination is necessary for the group to survive or flourish one such context being times of intergroup conflict    indeed  during times of intergroup conflict  dominant leaders subjugate their own interests for the good of the group   and aggressively defend the group s welfare    in these ways    dominant leaders can provide im  portant benefits to the group     third  another function that leaders serve is keeping group members in line and punishing free riders    that is  a leader is re  sponsible for punishing potentially exploitative group members    discouraging de  fection    and arbitrating conflict between group members    group members may see dominant leaders  willingness to use force as an asset in this regard  they may be seen as more capable of protecting the group from those who would undermine or exploit group cooperation   a final explanation for the emergence of dominant leader is more pessimistic about the benefits of dominant leaders  but rather suggests that dominant leader is more likely to attain and retain a position of high social rank when group members have limited outside alternatives to the dominant leader    that is  dominant leadership might flourish when group members are highly dependent on their leader  do not have good outside alternatives  or lack the ability to revolt    in these contexts  the leader may have more leeway to engage in coercive  selfish behavior   that would typically cause group members to reject the leader     prestige  in contrast to force based dominance hierarchies  hierarchies can also be based on prestige in our ancestral past  talented hunters or other skilled group members were deferred to because of their valued experience  skills  and ability to mentor and help others    thus  a prestige based strategy typically involves at  taining social rank by amassing the respect  admiration  and  freely conferred deference  of one s subordinates rather than through active subjugation of others    prestige  oriented individuals tend to demonstrate competence and expertise  which other group members value and admire    prestige as a form of hierarchy   and or a distinction between force based and persuasion based attempts at social rank    given this  the work on dual strategies theory lead by evolutionary psychologists does not necessarily represent an innovative new idea  but rather a conciliation and advancement of ideas from several different intellectual domains   k j  mcclanahan the leadership quarterly                 importantly  however  demonstrating competence alone is generally not enough to elicit respect and deference group members must also feel confident that the potential leader will use his or her skills to benefit the group    thus  a prestige strategy is thought to involve demonstration of expertise and magnanimity  so that other group members willingly defer to the potential leader    while dominant leaders tend to assert themselves and their will on other group members  prestige oriented leaders tend to display both prosocial behavior and knowledge and expertise in specific topic areas  increasing their trustworthiness and value in the eyes of others    one other reason that followers might defer to prestige oriented leaders is that prestige based leaders tend to be relatively egalitarian    which is thought to be preferable for most followers     patterns of prestige based deference generally benefitted both the leader and follower    followers were able to learn valuable information from successful individuals and also bene  fited from having a competent leader make group decisions    in turn  followers tended to offer deference and pres  tige to these successful individuals  although a prestige based strategy often required the leader to sacrifice for the good of the group    the leader was generally repaid with high social rank  which translated into an increased ability to attain personal goals  control resources  and influence others     although some scholars debate the precise mechanism by which dominance and prestige strategies were transmitted from generation to generation    there is abundant evidence that both strategies exists across a variety of contexts and cultures    which is typically con  sidered to be a major calling card of evolved human adaptations    furthermore  it is clear that   both of these strategies provided benefits to both leaders and followers  evolutionary psychologists suggest that when social inter  actions provide a net fitness benefit to the individuals within a group    these patterns of interaction are likely to persist and evolve    at a high level  this explains how dominance and prestige based hierarchies came to be widespread   in short  the dual strategies theory of social rank suggests that due to the pervasiveness of dominance and prestige in our evolutionary  past  the proclivity toward these strategies is still inherent in our psy  chology  consequently  the dual strategies theory of social rank sug  gests that even today  attempts to both attain and maintain positions of high social rank can be categorized into one of two distinct strategies  dominance or prestige    furthermore  while dom  inance and prestige are very different approaches to gaining and maintaining high social rank  dual strategies theory suggests that both strategies are effective ways of attaining social rank  representing  two ways to the top       dominance and prestige as individual tendencies  dual strategies theory suggests that while dominance and prestige are strategies for obtaining social rank  they can also reflect individual differences between individuals    that is  while it would be feasible for a person to enact a dominant strategy at one time and a prestige based strategy at another time  it is hypothesized that people tend to gravitate toward one strategy over the other  in this way  the terms  dominant  and  prestige oriented  can also be applied to a person who consistently deploys one of the strategies   research on dominance and prestige from an evolutionary psy  chology perspective suggests that this individual difference can also be conceptualized as a difference in motives in addition to a difference in behavior    specifically  maner and case   suggest that dominance is a reflection of the motivation for power  and prestige orientation reflects a motivation for status   this difference in motivation could explain a key difference in the psychology of dom  inance  and prestige oriented individuals  status is inherently other  focused gaining status necessitates that you consider the needs of others  as you depend on them to give you status    in contrast  power is something that can be taken other group members can be managed or manipulated in pursuit of resources or control    given this  it follows that dominant leaders would be inherently less focused on how others view them     one common and related debate in the study of human evolution is whether a given characteristic is uniquely human  there is a myriad of evidence that dominance hierarchies predate humans and are found across a myriad of spe  cies and genera  so there is no doubt that dominance is not uniquely human  researchers have debated whether prestige hierarchies are uniquely human  while this question does not significantly impact the application of dual stra  tegies theory to modern organizations  it may be of interest to note that some researchers argue that prestige based hierarchies are present in non human primates  because chimpanzees demonstrate social learning from higher ranking chimpanzees    indeed  many species rely on more informed group members to make decisions for the group  including elephants    whales    and birds    however  other re  searchers argue that prestige hierarchies in humans are distinct from the knowledge based hierarchies of non human animals  this argument is relies on the notion that a  prestige based social learning in humans is far more complex than the basic info copying seen in other mammals   and b  prestige includes the learning of norms and culture passed down through generations    that prestige hierarchies in humans are distinct from the knowledge based hierarchies of non human animals     yet another debate in this area revolves around how distinct dominance and prestige are  despite early anthropological work noting the dichotomy of strategies in obtaining positions of social rank    other anthro  pologists such as sahlins   did not differentiate between the strategies  suggesting that social rank in small scale societies was attained through a combination of both of cunning aggression and prestige  furthermore  chapais   argues that all social rank is attained through competence  and that dominance and prestige simply reflect competence in different domains  cha  pais also argues that because chimpanzee hierarchies include both forced based coercion and competence based attraction to high ranking individuals  the two strategies may have more overlap in terms of evolutionary origins than pre  viously thought  despite these claims  there is considerable evidence that dominance and prestige hierarchies result in distinct group processes    and that domi  nant and prestige based leaders have distinct psychologies and behavior    despite this  it is worth noting that in at least some samples  self reported dominance and prestige motivations are positively correlated    though peer reported prestige and dominance strategies tend not to be    see the section on  dominance and prestige as individual tendencies  below for further discus  sion on this distinction     while motivation for power status has been theorized to drive a tendency toward a dominance or prestige influence strategy  other work from evolu  tionary anthropology and evolutionary psychology points out that the strategy an individual employs is likely a reflection of their inherent resources and capabilities as well     for example  if an individual does not have the resources to use force or control others  a dominant strategy is likely to be ineffective  if an individual does not possess relevant or valued skills or knowledge  a prestige strategy is unlikely to be effective    thus  in addition to underlying motives for status vs  power  individuals likely employ strategies that are more likely to be efficacious for them   k j  mcclanahan the leadership quarterly             it should be noted  however  that the other oriented focus of pres  tige leaders could be  but is not necessarily  a sign of prosocial mo  tives it is possible that prestige oriented leaders are preoccupied with their own self interest    but are required to think about others and act prosocially in order to obtain this status  indeed  there is much evidence that in many human contexts prosociality   is rewarded with social status    those who violate cooperative norms by displaying selfishness are punished    ostracized    or suffer damaged reputations after being the target of gossip      thus  prestige focused individuals may   assume that they must focus on the needs of others in order to get what they want  status   consistent with this idea  there is some evidence that prestige or  iented leaders have a tendency to pander to the desires of other group members  when faced with making a popular choice which is not ideal for the group or an unpopular choice that would be good for the group  prestige    oriented leaders are likely to make a popular choice  even if it will negatively impact group performance    it is not clear if this pandering is a reflection of prestige oriented leaders  concerns about their own status or their de  sire to maintain positive relationships with others  but this does suggest that a  prosocial individuals care about what others think of them and b  that they sometimes let their own motives take precedence over what is best for the group    it is important to note that while dominance and prestige may seem like incompatible stra  tegies  self reports on dominance and prestige motivations are often positively correlated  though peer ratings and objectively coded mea  sures of dominance and prestige tend not to be positively correlated in    this is somewhat unsurprising  given that ob  servers often rely on inaccurate markers of prestige    however  it does indicate that while the same in  dividual might be motivated by both dominance and prestige  others perceive their behavioral strategies to follow just one of the two stra  tegies    adding to the complexity  the style an individual adopts   is likely to be driven by contextual factors  including intergroup conflict    resource inequality    or economic uncertainty     dual strategies theory and classic leadership theories  while research on leadership is vast  much of it has revolved around common themes  how does a leader exact compliance from her sub  ordinates  how important is a leader s socio emotional intelligence  how can a leader balance task and relational concerns  many of these questions are also at the heart of the dual strategies theory of social rank  for this reason  it is important to consider the dual strategies theory of social rank within the context of the leadership research  however  to this point  there have not been any systematic attempts to integrate the two bodies of research  below  i conduct the first review of dual strategies theory in the context of major theories about leadership with the aim of further elucidating what exactly dual strategies theory is and how it differs from leadership research and theory  defining the theory in terms of what it is not will hopefully shed more light on what precisely it adds to the literature   i specifically examine how the dual strategies theory relates to the following five leadership frameworks  a  blake and mouton s manage  rial grid  b  leader member exchange  c  transformational versus transactional leadership  d  servant leadership  and e  authoritarianism versus democratic leadership  while these five frameworks certainly do  not represent the entirety of relevant leadership theory  they were se  lected because they represent some of the most prominent and studied theories in the leadership literature   and or because of their thematic similarity to dominance or prestige  i briefly describe each of these theories  and then note some key ways in which they are similar to or different from dual strategies theory  it should be noted that this review is intentionally brief while it is possible to write at length about how the dual strategies theory of social rank relates to each of these theories  i refrain from such an extensive comparison  as the goal is to provide a high level picture of how dual strategies theory of social rank relates to the field of leadership as a whole     blake and mouton s managerial grid  in one of the landmark theories of leadership  blake and mouton   conceptualized leadership styles in terms of a managerial grid  this grid classified leaders on two dimensions their concern for the people they lead   and their concern for com  pleting group goals    blake and mouton specified that these concepts were orthogonal  and leaders could be high on one  both  or neither dimension  thus  the managerial grid provides a convenient way of classifying leadership approaches   dual strategies theory bears some important similarity to the work of blake and mouton  one reasonable integration of these theories is that relational orientation is one distinction between dominance and prestige oriented strategies  that is  dominant individuals tend to de  monstrate relatively low concern for others as they tend to be more preoccupied with their own desire to maintain or retain power    in contrast  prestige based individuals tend to be more concerned about their re  lationships with group members than are dominant individuals     in fact  this is one of the key distinctions between the strategies   the link between dominance prestige and task orientation is less clear  dominant individuals might be considered high on task orienta  tion because they are more concerned with pushing their own agenda rather than being diplomatic   or because they may be seen as willing to punish those who do not pull their weight on accomplishing group goals    however  it is not clear if this agentic tendency translates to a focus on accomplishing broader group goals  there is some limited   evidence that dominant leaders are  on average  more effective at coordinating tasks than prestige oriented leaders  leading to better group performance when there is a need for a high degree of coordination    this out performance might be a reflection of dominant leaders  focus on the completion of group tasks  but the mechanism and motives for augmented perfor  mance is mere speculation at this point  additionally  tyrannical and authoritarian leadership   have repeatedly been conceptually linked to a task orientation    but empirical evidence confirming this does not appear to exist   it is also not clear if prestige orientated leaders are high on task orientation  given that demonstrating competence is a hallmark of the prestige strategy  it follows that prestige oriented leaders would need to focus on task performance in order for their strategy to be effective  indeed  there is evidence that prestige oriented leaders tend to work harder toward group goals than their dominance oriented counterparts    however  it is not clear if this is a reflection of their task orientation  or their desire to help or please their group members     in short  themes of blake and mouton s managerial grid can be seen in dual strategies theory  in particular  the  concern for others  dimen  sion provides a great illustration of some of the differences between  k j  mcclanahan the leadership quarterly             dominance and prestige as strategies  on the other hand  it is less clear how dominance and prestige might interact with task orientation  which may provide an interesting avenue for future research   leader member exchange  leader member exchange theorizing   suggests that leaders and their individual followers interact in patterns of ex  change that both incur costs   and create value  lmx has shifted focus since its conception and early work    in its early days  the theory revolved around the idea that the leader follower relationship will be formed and maintained if the benefits for both the leader and the follower outweigh the costs    interest  ingly  this cost benefit analysis is very much in line with evolutionary perspectives on how humans determine whether a relationship is ben  eficial    however  in more recent research  lmx the  orizing is generally used to evoke the idea that leaders enact different leader follower relationships with each of their followers  and that these relationships vary in quality    for example  a leader might have a higher quality relationship with one of her five followers such that the quality of the relationship is significantly different than the leader s relationship with the other followers  this differential relationship quality among dif  ferent leader follower dyads is at the heart of current lmx research  the degree to which the leader follower relationship quality varies from follower to follower   is known as differentiation     lmx differs from the dual strategies theory in that it does not focus on the effectiveness of a leader s strategies per se  but rather focuses on whether the leader follow relationship is beneficial   for the leader and follower and whether the relationship quality varies from individual to individual  this different focus means that these theories can be used in conjunction to generate new potentially interesting re  search questions and a more complete picture of hierarchy and lea  dership  for example  what might a follower see as the costs and ben  efits of having a dominant versus prestige oriented leader  what types of follower characteristics predict high quality relationships with a dominant or prestige oriented leader  are dominant or prestige or  iented leaders more likely to have high differentiation  in other words  dual strategies theory suggests that our evolved psychology is in  herently attuned to leader and follower capacity in terms of both dominance and prestige  empirically investigating how these strategies are factored into lmx processes and relationships is likely to be an interesting and generative line of work   additionally  lmx and dual strategies theory share an important similarity  both theories have an explanation for leadership emergence in addition to be relevant to in established hierarchies    early work on lmx provides a theoretical explanation for leadership emergence  it suggests that a leader emerges when such an arrangement will provide more benefits to both the group and to the leader    while the subsequent empirical research on lmx has largely examined exchange in established  formalized leadership contexts and thus has lacked integration with research on leadership emergence    leadership acquisition was a core focus of seminal work on this theory and thus represents a key simi  larity to dual strategies theory   transformational   leadership  a large body of leadership research has suggested that while many leaders adhere to a transaction focused type of leadership style  some  particularly inspired leaders move beyond this to a transformational leadership style  while a transactional leadership style is characterized by leaders attempting to maintain or increase efficiency within an ex  isting set of processes  a transformational leader inspires and motivates followers through an improved or entirely new process    thus  a transformational leader focuses on change   they shift the cur  rent processes and relationship into something better or more fulfilling for their employees  whereas a transactional leader s focus is on en  suring that employees are fulfilling their roles  a transformational leadership style has consistently been associated with gains in group performance     while a focus on enacting change is not specifically addressed in dual strategies theory  one could theorize how dominance or prestige strategies might be associated with transformational leadership  there are several reasons to think that dominant leaders would not be inter  ested in exercising transformational leadership  first  transformational leadership is other focused and generally prosocial in nature    this is the antithesis of dominant leaders  who are more likely to view their subordinates as potential threats to their position and therefore often act in ways that actually diminish their group members  ability to grow    concerned with keeping their own position of power  dominant leaders are more likely to try to maintain the power differential between themselves and their group inspiring and transforming their subordinates goes against this goal  however  it should be noted that this does not necessarily mean that dominant leaders are precluded from engaging in the  large  scale change  aspect of transformational leadership while the proso  cial elements of transformational leadership are unlikely to be posi  tively linked with dominance  changing processes or systems is not necessarily outside the purview of dominant leadership   there are a few reasons to think that prestige‑leaders might be likely to exercise transformational leadership  first  prestige oriented leaders tend to be more other focused than dominant leaders    fitting with transformational leader s pro  social aims  second  prestige oriented leaders are thought to be inter  ested in the respect and admiration of their followers  and they might see transformational leadership as a way to gain that respect and es  teem  improving group processes might be one way to effectively de  monstrate competence and selflessness  both characteristics that are likely to evoke admiration    this is particularly likely to be the case given that transformation leadership is more difficult to enact than transactional leadership styles    successfully implementing a difficult change would very likely garner more respect and status in the eyes of others   at the same time  some have theorized that part of the draw of prestige oriented leaders is that their leadership style is generally not seen as commandeering or demanding  decreasing the likelihood that prestige oriented leaders are seen as power hungry upstarts    thus  a prestige oriented leader might avoid making major changes to group processes as these changes might be seen as imposing their will on the group  offending egalitarian tendencies    prestige oriented leaders may also struggle making changes if they are concerned that such changes will upset other group members    thus  the question of whether prestige would be correlated with transformational leadership remains unclear  what is clear at this point is that the constructs can  in principle  be orthogo  nal it is easy to imagine a prestige oriented leader who engaged in transformational leadership and one who did not   the integration of these theories provides for new possible research avenues  for example  does transformational leadership increase per  ceptions of a leader s prestige    it may also be worth  while to examine the motives of transformational leaders from a dual  strategies perspective do leaders exercise this type of leadership solely out of prosocial motives  or is transformational leadership a reflection  k j  mcclanahan the leadership quarterly             of a prestige like desire for the respect and admiration that this type of leadership might garner  interesting questions also revolve around dominance and transformational leadership  for example  while transformational leadership refers to change orientation  this change is usually assumed to be prosocial  yet there is some evidence that dominant leaders might be willing to implement changes to the group processes in ways that advantage themselves    could this change orientation be viewed as a type of anti  social transformational leadership  further exploration of this trans  formational vs  transactional leadership through the lens of dual stra  tegies theory would likely be enlightening for both literatures  finally  another opportunity for integration of these theories revolves around whether leaders change from transactional leadership to transforma  tional leadership   over time or depending on the contexts  if such changes occur  perhaps dual strategies theory could explain when and why a leader might employ one of these styles   servant leadership  servant leadership is a leadership style in which leaders  combine their motivation to lead with a need to serve     servant leaders are thought to focus less on the benefits of their position  but instead on benefitting their group members    as such  servant leaders are characterized by hu  mility  empathy  and stewardship   and the needs of followers are more likely to be at the forefront of their mind    although the concept of servant leadership was introduced by greenleaf in    serious empirical study of servant leadership has just commenced recently     even the most cursory of comparisons between dominance and servant leadership would likely elicit the conclusion that dominant leaders are not likely to enact servant leadership in general  dom  inance leaders are more likely to focus on their own gain rather than how they can serve their group  a prestige based strategy  on the other hand  bears significant resemblance to the concept of servant leader  ship  like servant leaders  prestige based leaders are more likely to make significant sacrifices for the welfare of their groups and work hard to benefit other group members     however  the theorizing on prestige diverges from theorizing on servant leadership in at least two key ways  first  servant leadership does not speak to competence  and demonstrating competence is likely to be one of the key ways in which prestige oriented leaders gain status in social groups    second  the motivation proscribed for self  sacrifice is differs between these theories  servant leadership theories suggest that servant leaderships sacrifice for their group members due to compassionate love   and a focus on their followers    servant leaders are attributed truly selfless motives   the needs of others  are their  highest priority     while prestige leaders are thought to be focused on the needs of their group members  the reason for this may ultimately be self interested  prestige leaders may make personal sa  crifices for the group  but in return  they typically receive status    status is inherently valuable as it brings them preferential treatment  increased influence  and a heightened ability to accomplish their goals    in this way  the sacrificial nature of prestige based leaders may be   designed for their own benefit   rather than for truly selfless reasons  supporting the idea that differing motives may be at play  servant leadership is negatively correlated with narcissism    while prestige leadership is actually positively correlated with narcissism     this offers opportunities for empirical investigation  the first re  volves around whether servant leadership actually reflects true al  truism  or whether servant leadership is often prestige leadership in disguise i e   leaders reporting selfless motives because they know that doing so will grant them respect and admiration  another avenue re  volves around group members  abilities to distinguish between these two types of leadership  if truly altruistic servant leaders do exist  can group members differentiate between self sacrificing leaders who are truly interested in the development of group members and those who are sacrificing to garner personal benefit or prestige  the ability to differentiate between these motives could be an important ability for followers  but at this point it is unclear whether people have the ca  pacity to differentiate     authoritarianism versus democratic leadership  the degree to which leaders use force to induce compliance from their followers has long been a theme of leadership research    specifically  authoritarian   leaders who use strength and force to ensure the group accomplishes their goal  s are often contrasted with democratic leaders who distribute the power to make decisions among group members and include other group members in their responsibilities      although authoritarianism has been ne  glected by the research in recent decades  recent political events have provoked a renewed interest in the topic     authoritarianism  with its emphasis on coercion and control  maps well onto the concept of dominance  however  although many scholars treat dominance as synonymous with having an orientation toward power    it is not clear whether this  desire for power  is truly a motivation for power   or whether it is a motivation for a po  sition of high social rank more broadly  this distinction is important from the perspective of dual strategies theory because the theory sug  gests that prestige oriented leaders might be just as motivated as dominant individuals are for a position of social rank  but they may focus more on status hierarchies    thus  it is unclear how prestige oriented leaders who strongly desire high status might fit into this framework   while prestige oriented leaders tend to be more democratic in their leadership style    a prestige strategy is not synonymous with democratic leadership  for one  competence is an important facet of a prestige based approach  but it is not a key factor in the democratic leadership style  furthermore  democratic leadership tends to be a description of how a leader behaves or a group interacts  whereas prestige provides an additional element  the leader s motivation when engaging in power sharing    finally  democratic leadership generally refers to a leadership style employed after being put into a position of high social rank     the unique focus of dual strategies theory  although the dual strategies theory of social rank touches on many of the same themes of leadership research    its evolutionary origins and focus on social rank give it a unique focus relative to most leadership research  dual strategies theory is unique in that it was devised by thinking about small  cohesive  constantly shifting groups that humans populated during the time of our evolu  tionary history    as opposed to the typical formal organizational context where many leadership theories  k j  mcclanahan the leadership quarterly             of the  th and  st century were conceived    this evolutionary background alone does not provide sufficient justification for the use of the theory  however  i argue that focusing on these small  informal hierarchies has given dual strategies theory a unique and much needed perspective on leadership that would benefit the larger body of research on leadership  this new perspective is not intended to replace other leadership theories  but rather can add to their contribution to our understanding of leaders and followers in organizations  below  i outline a few ways in which dual strategies theory of social rank represents a departure from most research on leadership and describe why its unique foci make it particularly well  equipped to explain today s modern organizations and workforce  specifically  i highlight how dual strategies theory s emphasis on shifting power dynamics  its focus on informal hierarchies  and the introduction of prestige as a counterpoint to dominance is relevant to today s economy     emphasis on acquiring social rank and shifts in power  much of the organizational behavior research on leadership focuses on a leader follower relationship that is already in place  while research on leadership emergence is certainly still present    it is somewhat removed from work examining formal leadership    furthermore  the research on leadership emergence has largely lacked theoretical underpinnings    while leadership theory has primarily focused situations in which the leader has already attained their position of leadership     similarly  the majority of research in the field of organizational behavior on leadership assumes hierarchies to be rather static  the focus is on how leaders and followers each enact their roles  but there is not a lot of emphasis on how these roles might change or how the power dynamics might shift within a group  in short  most of the work on leadership acknowledges the power asymmetry between leader and follower  but beyond this  ignores any power dynamics in work groups and organizations   in contrast  dual strategies research has investigated both the ac  quisition of social rank and leadership behaviors in established hier  archies    and the theory itself provides a conceptual framework to explain both phenomena  it also focuses on how instabilities within the hier  archy can impact a leader s goals    integrating dual strategies theory into leadership research might help reinvigorate an interest in the leadership emergence in more traditional leadership theory and provide a way of bringing the two bodies of literature to  gether  furthermore  dual strategies theory assumes a world in which no leadership position is immutable and hierarchies are constantly changing  so the emphasis is on how people take advantage of or pro  tect against power shifts   this focus on shifting hierarchies and the acquisition of social rank is important given demographic trends in employment  specifically  younger employees are far less likely to stay with the same company for their entire career than workers just a generation ago    this means that in the future  the workforce is likely to be increasingly composed of employees who move from organization to organization more frequently than in the past    this increased mobility means that people are regularly entering and navi  gating new work groups and hierarchies  making the acquisition of social rank a crucially important factor in organizations  furthermore  the decreased tenure of employees inherently makes hierarchies less stable as employees leave  hierarchies need to be restructured to fill these gaps or accommodate external hires   beyond employees choosing to move organizations more frequently  there is more of a demand for temporary workers  short term and  contract work is representing an increasing proportion of work in the united states    in this so called  gig economy     the constant flow of workers in and out of organizations   is likely to contribute to constantly changing hierarchies   thus  the typical organizational hierarchies are likely less stable than they were when many of the classic leadership theories emerged  and theory that is able to explain and predict these power and status changes will be a boon to leadership researchers  furthermore  this focus on how hierarchies develop and change over time answers calls to make leadership research more focused on process and changing dy  namics     emphasis on informal hierarchy  with the exception of the work on leadership emergence  the vast majority of the research on leadership in organizational behavior ex  amines formal hierarchies    there is certainly an acknowledgement that one does not need to have formal leadership position to demonstrate leadership  but most of the empirical work has focused on the formal organizational context     in contrast  in the small groups of our evolutionary past  there was no such thing as formal hierarchy dictated by a larger organization  indeed  the vast majority of human history likely took place in rela  tively egalitarian contexts that lacked formal hierarchy    for this reason  there remains in dual strategies theory an emphasis on informal hierarchies    while formal hierarchies still play a huge role in today s or  ganizations  there are a few reasons to believe that informal hierarchies are increasingly of particular importance to organizations   first  there is an increasing segment of the population that is opting out of employment in a traditional organization in favor of freelance work    for these workers  formal organizational hierarchy may not be particularly re  levant rather than worrying about their interactions with their boss or their chances of getting promoted  they instead are focused on their performance in the eyes of their clientele and the way that they stack up relative to other freelance workers in their field  this employment reality  faced by an increasing number of workers  would likely be considered outside the wheelhouse of most traditional leadership the  ories  however  dual strategy theory s emphasis on informal hierarchies makes it well equipped to explain how leadership and hierarchy are relevant for gig and freelance workers   second  there is some evidence that egalitarianism is increasingly promoted as a management strategy    self managing teams are increasingly common    knowledge work which is inherently less suited to authority and hierarchy   is representing an increasingly proportion of work    and the majority of firms now use agile project management  which emphasizes collaborative workflows in which egalitarianism is valued    while there is likely a great deal of variation in the degree to which organizations actually adopt egalitarian ideals  de  centralization of decision making power appears to be increasingly common even among large  multi national corporations    because humans appear to have natural tendencies toward hierarchy of some kind    a decreasing reliance on formal hierarchies is likely result in increasingly important status and informal hierarchies    a focus for dual strategies  k j  mcclanahan the leadership quarterly             theory  furthermore  if egalitarianism is widely valued  group members are likely to punish  upstarts  who try to claim power through force    understanding how potential leaders can obtain in  fluence in such contexts is therefore key to understanding influence in today s organizations  dual strategies theory articulates a strategy   that fits these parameters   third  it is becoming more readily apparent that even organizations with steep  formal hierarchies are shaped by the informal hierarchies of their employees  for example  there is evidence that group performance appears to be determined in part by the informal hierarchies among group members    additionally  one s informal social landscape can impact promotion in the formal organization hierarchy    thus  even in traditionally hierarchical firms  dual strategy theory s emphasis on informal hierarchies is worth considering   prestige as a counterpart to dominance  one of the major contributions of the dual strategies theory of social rank is the introduction of the prestige strategy as a counterpart to dominance  as noted above  dominance or similar variants such as authoritarianism  autocratic  or directive leadership have long been a subject of leadership research  many of these theories have described alterative leadership strategies that do not use force or coercion    however  prestige differs from these strategies in a few key ways  first  as articulated earlier  demonstrating competence is a key element to a prestige strategy  second  a prestige oriented strategy may not inherently be prosocial  while prestige oriented leaders act in extremely prosocial ways  their own personal desire for status is thought to un  derlie much of their group oriented behavior  this represents a unique combination of traits  strategies  and motives that has not been re  flected in the leadership literature up to this point   there are several reasons why investigating prestige makes sense in the modern work context  first  with the dawn of the information age  having unique  complicated skillsets and competencies is increasingly important for employees    in the past  when employees were more likely to be in menial or non technical jobs  seniority or tenure were much larger factors in determining promotion    however  in today s knowledge economy    em  ployee knowledge and skills are more important than ever  bringing competence to the forefront of decisions as to who will attain positions at the top of the hierarchy  prestige s focus on demonstrating skills as a basis for deference is particularly relevant in this employment climate   additionally  as mentioned above  organizations are increasingly characterized by informal and shifting hierarchies  interestingly  these hierarchies often lead to more social rank related conflicts    and may make status a more valued commodity  because prestige is thought to reflect a desire for status  it may be a particularly informative construct to investigate in this modern context   how leadership research can enhance dual strategies theory  just as introducing the dual strategies theory of social rank into the broader leadership research can provide unique insights into the study of leadership in organizations  insights from the rich body of leadership theory and research can increase the viability and veracity of the dual  strategies theory of social rank  below  i describe three ways in which leadership theory and research can   be integrated into the work dual strategies theory in order to provide a more robust field of inquiry  specifically  i describe how an increased focused on the group  the impact of contextual factors on the effectiveness of dominance and prestige  and more consideration of organizational factors such as formal hierarchy  diversity  and technology are important areas in which to expand this are of research   stronger focus on the group  a central focus of leadership research has been the leader s impact on the group  indeed  leadership research continues to shift from a focus on leadership traits to a process and group focus    dual strategies theory  on the other hand  has largely focused on the psychology of the leader  with relatively few studies looking at the experience of the group or the effectiveness of the group  it should be noted that this reflects a disconnect between theory and actual re  search while dual strategies theory has a heavy focus on the actual group context  the empirical research on dual strategies theory has maintained a rather consistent focus on the individual employing the strategy  for example  up to this point   effectiveness  from a dual  strategies perspective has referred to whether the leader is able to attain a position of social rank  not whether the group is successful in ac  complishing their goals    the ef  fects of each of these strategies on group performance is likely to be one of the primary questions with which organizations and practitioners are concerned  so this certainly represents an important area for future research   there has also been very little research that considers the perspec  tive of the followers  an area of research that is experiencing a revival in organizational behavior research    the extant literature suggests that other group members tend to dislike dominant individuals    except in instances such as economic un  certainty or intergroup conflict    but beyond this  dual stra  tegies theory cannot speak to how followers perceive dominant or prestige oriented leaders   there is likely a high degree of individual variation in how a sub  ordinate may respond to dominant or prestige based leader  research from lmx suggests that leaders have distinct relationships with each of their followers  and that the quality of the leader follower relationship is a function of both the leader and the follower    yet  leader follower fit has not been discussed in the work on dom  inance and prestige  despite conjectures that follower traits are likely an important factor in understanding how controlling leaders in particular attain positions of influence     beyond follower s perceptions of or desire for dominant and pres  tige oriented leadership  it is also worth considering how fellow group members influence whether an individual employs a dominance or prestige based strategy  leadership theory suggests that the effective  ness of a leadership style is impacted by the traits of the followers    and it is easy to imagine that leaders would shift their strategies depending on the qualities and behavior of group members  a further discussion of dominance and prestige as strategies that include input from group members would be a boon to this area of research   an investigation of context  researchers as early as the  s have suggested that it is fruitless to study the effectiveness of any given leadership strategy without in  formation about context    that is  a leadership strategy that might be wildly effective in a group of   year old boys may not be efficacious in a team of research scientists  thus  it is widely accepted in general leadership research that the effectiveness of leadership traits or strategies are contingent on the situation    however  to this point  dual strategies theory has paid little attention to how contextual factors impact dom  inance and prestige as strategies  this represents a serious limitation to this area of research and also a great opportunity for further work   there has been some discussion of contextual factors that impact the behavior of dominant or prestige oriented leaders  including intergroup  k j  mcclanahan the leadership quarterly             competition  stability of the hierarchy  and the anonymity of decision making    however  research on how contextual factors impact on the effectiveness of dominance and prestige as strategies for attaining social rank and leading groups has been minimal  thus far  research has indicated that the viability of dominance as a strategy increases with economic instability  group status threat  and intergroup conflict    there is also some evidence that dominance might be more effective in short term contexts    in situations where it is challenging for group members to revolt    or in situations where a leader is expected to punish free riders    there has been some theorizing that prestige might be a better strategy for prompting creativity  while dominance might be better effective for tasks requiring coordination    but this lacks empirical evidence  indeed  others argue that prestige based lea  ders might possess superior coordination abilities due to their increased knowledge and presumed ability to intelligently solve complex tasks    in short  our empirical understanding of how the effectiveness of dominance and prestige varies from situation to situation is extremely limited   the lack of attention to context is a surprising oversight in dual  strategies theory  as it is hard to imagine that the efficacy of these strategies would not vary widely depending on the nature and purpose of the group or the broader organization  for example  the effectiveness of dominance or prestige is likely to be impacted by components of the group task such as domain  degree of interdependence required  time pressure  and performance pressure  expectations of the leader s role are also worth considering  is the leader s primary responsibility co  ordinating tasks  motivating subordinates  mentoring them  advocating for the group  these distinct purposes are likely to impact the type of leader desired  finally  broader contextual factors such as group size  the formality and complexity of the organizational struc  ture  organizational culture  and even firm performance are likely to impact who is promoted and which leaders are deemed successful  ul  timately shaping whether a dominance or prestige strategy is effective  in short  there are likely dozens of contextual factors that impact the effectiveness of dominance and prestige    a serious examination of these factors is an important next step for the application of dual strategies theory to modern organizations   more attention to modern organizational facets  while the focus on informal authority  small groups  and shifting hierarchies is likely to shed important insights into modern organiza  tions    there are some facets of modern organizations that dual strategies theory has not yet explicitly addressed  in parti  cular  dual strategies theory could provide a more complete portrait for dominance and prestige in modern organizations with more explicit consideration of factors such as a  formal hierarchy  b  demographic diversity  and c  technology   first  despite the argument above that many of today s employees work in increasingly egalitarian contexts  many people still work in large  bureaucratic organizations  dual strategies theory was initially devised to describe contexts in which positions of social rank were determined solely by an individual s ability to garner followers  not on his her ability to navigate preexisting institutional hierarchies    indeed  much of the empirical research on dual strategies theory has focused on this context  additionally  much research on leadership emergence broadly and dual strategies theory specifically assumes that fellow group members elect a leader  however  the reality of most organizations is that a leader is put into place by people above them in the organization    how might leadership selection vary when the person selecting the leader will not  be his her subordinate  to my knowledge  this question remains un  answered   another area for advancement involves issues of race  gender  and diversity  which are dramatically different in a modern organization than they were in the small scale societies of our evolutionary past  for example  in small scale societies thought to characterize the eea  groups typically did not have mixed gender hierarchies    similarly  it was uncommon for these groups to have contact with groups of other races    it is therefore unsurprising that dual strategies theory does not explicitly theorize about how these strategies interact with gender or race in organizations  however  gender and race relations in the workplace are important and salient hierarchies in organizations   and these hierarchies are likely navigated using dominance or prestige based strategies    beyond this  however  gender and racial hierarchies are complicated  nuanced  and distinct from other hierarchies  for example  there is evidence that dominance is perceived differently based on the leader s gender    race    sexual orientation    or inter  sectionality    thus  research on how demographic characteristics such as race  gender  sexual or  ientation  as well as the intersection of these factors  is likely to provide important insights beyond the purview of dual strategies theory   in a similar vein  the pervasiveness of modern technology can dra  matically change the dynamics of a work group for example  how might dominance and or prestige manifest themselves in work groups that primarily work remotely  dual strategies theory was developed with the assumption that groups were co located and communicated face to face  given that much of today s work does not follow this pattern  considering how and when technology impacts these strategies may be an important next step in the application of dual strategies theory to the modern workplace   conclusion  while most leadership theories were developed by looking at the large  stagnant  and bureaucratic organizations of the  th century  the dual strategies theory of social rank focuses on the informal leader  follower dynamics that characterize most of human history    because of its evolutionary origins  the dual strategies theory of social rank provides a unique perspective on leadership that is also surprisingly well equipped for application to modern workplace environments  the aim of this review was to provide a guide to un  derstanding dual strategies theory in the context of leadership theory and research and to demonstrate the efficacy of dual strategies theory in answering important questions about leadership and hierarchy in modern organizations  one main conclusion of this review is that future research that integrates ideas from broader leadership theory into dual  strategies theory   is likely to improve dual stra  tegies theory and provide unique insight into today s evolving
