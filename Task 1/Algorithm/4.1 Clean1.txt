healthy leadership health oriented leadership health promoting leadership systematic review  a b s t r a c t  employee health and wellbeing are important concerns for organizations  and it has long been known that social support from leaders has a salutogenic influence on their followers  over the past decade  several models of  healthy leadership  have been introduced  with the aim of theoretically integrating leadership research with scholarship on occupational health and wellbeing  we present a systematic review and critique of the literature on these models of  healthy leadership  and associated evidence from empirical studies    in addition  we compare various models of  healthy leadership  and critically evaluate evidence for their incremental predictive validity above and beyond established leadership constructs    we conclude with a discussion of problems in the  healthy leadership  literature   and outline a  new agenda  of prescriptive recommendations for  healthy leadership  theory  development  research  and practice   introduction  ensuring high levels of employee health and wellbeing is an im  portant concern for organizations  healthier employees perform work tasks more efficiently    are less likely to quit their jobs    are more likely to perform extra  role behaviors    and are more satisfied with their jobs    ad  ditionally  it has long been known that social support has a salutogenic influence on health and wellbeing    and this especially includes social support from leaders    until recently  however  there have not been explicit theoretical models and empirical studies that posit the influence of  healthy leadership  attitudes  values  and behaviors on employee health and wellbeing  to account for the health specific influence of leaders on employee  health and wellbeing  scholars have introduced various models of  healthy leadership  over the past decade    health and wellbeing are typically understood here  and within the  healthy lea  dership  literature  to encompass physical  mental  and social well  being  and not just the absence of disease    we use the term  healthy leadership  broadly to refer to these health related lea  dership models and associated constructs  including health  and  wellbeing specific leader attitudes    values    and or behaviors    in this article  we present a systematic review and critique of the  literature on  healthy leadership   although we review the entirety of this literature  we particularly focus on health promoting and health  oriented leadership  as these concepts have received substantial atten  tion  both empirically   and in terms of conceptual devel  opment    until now  such an effort has not been undertaken  particularly one that contrasts these various models against one another and criti  cally evaluates evidence for their incremental predictive validity above and beyond established leadership constructs    importantly  our review focuses specifically on  healthy leadership   models  and not on research that has considered associations between established leadership constructs   and employee health and well  being    we also do not consider relation  ships between established leadership constructs and leader health and wellbeing    however  to better understand the positioning of  healthy lea  dership  among these established leadership frameworks  we do draw conceptual parallels where relevant     received   october    received in revised form   september    accepted   september    ⁎ corresponding author  e mail address        the leadership quarterly        available online   october        ©   elsevier inc  all rights reserved   t                  the central arguments and contributions we offer are three fold  first  our review argues that because various  healthy leadership  models have emerged in parallel  there is a great deal of theoretical and empirical overlap between them to be noted and critically examined  this observation raises questions about the possibility of construct proliferation    and we suggest ways to address this issue in future research  second  consistent with recent criticisms of the transformational leadership literature    we propose that research on  healthy leadership  confounds actual leadership behavior with its intended outcomes of employee health and wellbeing  defining and measuring  healthy leadership  in terms of its beneficial effects on these outcomes is problematic  because it does not allow valid conclusions regarding the effectiveness of this form of leadership behavior  finally  we ques  tion and critically examine whether theoretical and empirical research has sufficiently addressed the issue of the incremental validity   of  healthy leadership  for predicting employee health and wellbeing  to frame these arguments  our paper is organized around four  specific and interrelated goals  first  we begin by introducing the background and potential importance of  healthy leadership   and by describing various  healthy leadership  constructs that can be found in the literature  second  we further explore  healthy leadership  con  ceptualizations by comparing and contrasting common and unique predictions made by these various models  third  we present a sys  tematic and critical literature review of empirical   studies on  healthy leadership   finally  we outline an in  tegrative research agenda that offers prescriptive recommendations for  healthy leadership  theory development  future research  and practice   review of  healthy leadership  models and constructs  there is evidence that work environments are increasingly experi  enced as stressful by employees  for example  job demands have in  creased over time  particularly cognitive demands associated with knowledge jobs    to address this issue  organizations have dedicated quite a bit of attention toward systems that support employee health and wellbeing    such systems can take many forms  from more tangible formal policies and benefits to less tangible forms of social support  one particularly important source of such support is one s immediate supervisor  the imperative of organizations and lea  ders to support their employees  health and wellbeing is a key compo  nent of their  duty of care   for employees  maintaining high levels of health and wellbeing is an important factor in their long term em  ployability    often citing the shortcomings of established leadership models with  regard to these trends   healthy leadership  models seek to add to our ability to explain and make predictions about how leaders influence the health and wellbeing of their followers  for example  franke  vincent  and felfe   motivate the development of their health oriented leadership measure by suggesting that established models of leadership  such as transformational leadership  are  too vague about specific health related actions of leaders     next  we describe health  promoting and health oriented leadership  two dominant  healthy leadership  concepts found in the literature  we additionally describe a number of related conceptualizations that appear less frequently in this literature  but that also address core themes of  healthy leadership   table   summarizes these various  healthy leadership  constructs  their  table    healthy

as measures of  healthy leadership   with the exception of the cpq   c  w   r udolph   et al   the leadership q uarterly             definitions  and relevant citations  we trace the development of these models and constructs and critically discuss attempts to quantify them via the development of measurement instruments     health promoting leadership  much of the early work on  healthy leadership  emerged from the public health and health promotion literatures from scandinavian  nordic countries  an early conceptualization termed health promoting leadership is attributed to hanson    who identified three core dimensions  personal leadership    pedagogical leadership    and strategic health promoting leadership    integrating hanson s   ideas  eriksson   refined and  clarified the definition of health promoting leadership  suggesting that it    concerns itself with creating a culture for health promoting workplaces and values that inspire and motivate employees to partici  pate in such a development   eriksson et al    identified three components of health promoting leadership  including having a sup  portive leadership style  organizing health promoting activities  and developing a health promoting workplace  which could be roughly mapped onto the three aspects of health promoting leadership proposed by hanson    eriksson et al    also suggests various motives for the development of health promoting leadership    a number of  critical conditions  for the suc  cessful enactment of health promoting leadership were also proposed  including organizational conditions    leader  specific characteristics    and support afforded to leaders themselves    research concerning health promoting leadership has frequently  adopted qualitative methods  that said  there have been various at  tempts to develop psychometric instruments to quantify aspects of health promoting leadership    arguing that previous models have adopted an approach that is too leader centric    jiménez  bregenzer  kallus  fruhwirth  and wagner hartl   sought to expand the concept to include leader  ship strategies that support and enhance healthy workplaces  jiménez  bregenzer  kallus  et al    further suggests that this is important  because healthy working environments are optimally understood by the interaction of individual and organizational factors  according to this model  there are seven unique elements that comprise a healthy workplace culture    it is suggested that these seven elements are organized as a circumplex  with health promoting leadership as its  core   of note  this model has not  to our knowledge  ever been operationalized with this circumplex structure  in developing their measure of health promoting leadership   jiménez  bregenzer  kallus  et al    translated this model into six dimensions of  work life  borrowed from previous work by maslach and leiter    additionally  one dimension that maps onto  health awareness  is said to reflect  health promoting leadership conditions   considering item content  only this  health awareness  dimension really captures leader behavior specific to health promotion  somewhat consistent with the motivation to  balance  individual and organiza  tional factors  the other six dimensions more readily capture elements of the perceived work environment   or elements of job design    although it would be hard to argue that such elements are not important for health and wellbeing at work in general  only the three items of this scale from the  health awareness  dimension map specifically to leaders  actions  moreover  although jiménez  bregenzer  kallus  et al    argue that healthy working environments are best conceptualized as the interaction of the  individual   and these organizational factors captured by this scale  no specific guidance is given for how to use this scale to account for such interactions  and no studies that we identified in our review have explicitly modeled such interactive relationships  taking a broader view  the important thing to note about this scale   particularly when contrasting its implied dimensionality and item content against the models of health promoting leadership described above    is the absence of overlap between the theoretical models and the way that health promoting leadership is measured  drawing parallels between these scales and their   underlying theory requires a large inferential leap in many cases  for example  it is hard to rationalize the argument that a theory designed to explain leaders  behavior is too leader centric    this is actually a symptom of a larger concern  in that to some extent  the status of  health promoting leadership  suffers from confusion over construct labeling  indeed  many models and operationalizations share this common label  but their underlying content is far less aligned than their similar names would suggest     health oriented leadership  at the same time that the model of health promoting leadership was emerging  the concept of health oriented leadership was explored em  pirically by franke and felfe    in contrast to the model of health  promoting leadership described above  the model of health oriented leadership was developed by a largely deductive process  according to franke and felfe    health oriented leadership deviates from es  tablished and more general leadership models in that it addresses specific aspects of leaders  communication and the health promoting design of working conditions  as well as leaders  values and their awareness of followers  health  the measure of health oriented leader  ship also serves to assess followers  health oriented values  awareness  and behavior  with components of health oriented leadership re  presenting health oriented leadership behavior  health related aware  ness  self efficacy  attitudes  and values  unpacking this definition further  health oriented leadership beha   viors can be described both in terms of those related to communication or direct interaction between leaders and followers  from the followers  perspective  and in terms of behaviors that consider the health con  scious design of working processes and maintenance of healthy working conditions  a heuristic model of the process by which health oriented leadership influences follower health and wellbeing was developed by franke  ducki  and felfe      this model is pseudo ecological in its nature  describing the influence of health or  iented leadership across different levels of analysis  between leaders  and subordinates  perceptions and behaviors  it depicts a  house of health promoting leadership   the  foundation  of this house is com  prised of leaders   self care   or the way leaders deal with their own health  including how they think  feel  and act in relation to their own health  moving up one level  leaders   self care  influences how they role model health to their followers     staff care  in  volves the perceived manifestation of leaders  values  awareness  and behaviors as recognized by their followers  for example  followers  perceptions that it is important to their leader to actively reduce health risks and that their leader notices when something is wrong with their health   staff care   in turn  influences how followers manage their own health    health and wellbeing are depicted on the  top floor  of the house  with the assumption that leaders   self care  posi  tively influences followers   self care  through  staff care   franke and felfe   developed a measure of health oriented  leadership in german  an english version of this scale is provided by franke  felfe  and pundt    adding ambiguity  franke et al    inexplicably relabeled their translated version of this measure as an index of health promoting leadership  to avoid confusion in our re  view  we characterize all studies using either version of this scale as  c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             health oriented leadership  the scale captures the components of health  oriented leadership described above  as well as health related attitudes and values  the health oriented leadership scale can capture either leader reported self assessments   or external assessments completed by followers    often  however  only one of these forms is used in research  feasibly  for any given component of health oriented leadership   one could obtain scores on leaders   self care   leaders   staff care   and their followers  perceived  staff care   because the health oriented leadership model and its associated  measurement instrument potentially account for perceived leader and follower values  awareness  and behaviors  it is feasible to hypothesize and test reciprocal dyadic leader follower relationships  despite this  because the model only specifies simple   associa  tions    it is unclear how such dyadic effects would emerge or de  velop over time  this is especially true given that single time point  common source methodologies   are most typically used to study associations between health  oriented leadership and follower outcomes   additional  healthy leadership  models  although the models of health promoting and health oriented lea  dership are by far the most commonly cited models of  healthy lea  dership   there are a number of related models that appear less fre  quently within this literature  despite their relatively low prevalence  these models are important to note because they have served as a basis for the empirical study of  healthy leadership   and because they ex  emplify the proliferation of constructs in this space  table   provides definitions of each of these constructs  and we next review them each briefly  one early construct  organizational leadership for health promotion     should not be confused with the similarly named  yet less often studied individual leadership for health promotion construct    described as a multidimensional and ecological system of actions  organizational leadership for health promotion in  volves various processes of health promotion  from goal setting to im  plementation  with an emphasis on continuous development  barrett et al    developed a measure of organizational leadership for health promotion  which assesses four dimensions  including  practices for organizational learning    wellness planning    workplace milieu   and  organizational member development   importantly  none of the items that reflect these dimensions address leadership behaviors or styles per se  confusing matters further  this construct is often inter  changeably labeled as  leadership for heart health promotion   how  ever  no references to cardiovascular functioning are explicitly made    della  dejoy  goetzel  ozminkowski  and wilson   introduced  the concept of management support for worksite health promotion  which includes  among other aspects  leadership support for health promotion  the  leading by example  instrument  an index designed to capture different aspects of management support for worksite health promo  tion  includes three items that purport to capture leadership support for health promotion from the followers  perspective  this index has by  and large been used descriptively  for example  to document changes to workplace health promotion efforts over time    beyond follower perceptions  the concept of health specific leadership    is described as a distinct set of lea  dership behaviors that influence employee health  these behaviors in  clude responsibility for employee health  communication about health  related topics  or setting agendas for workplace health promotion  the logic is that  by highlighting the importance of health  leaders are able to influence their followers  health  to operationalize health specific  leadership  gurt et al    use the organizational health and safety questionnaire    which assesses both general and health specific forms of leadership from the follower s perspective  in terms of both task and relationship related leadership behaviors  vincent   offers a model of health  and development   promoting leadership  which is defined by high levels of support and development related leadership behaviors  and low levels of demanding leadership behaviors    to help explain the mechanisms through which leaders affect followers  wellbeing  vincent   developed a measure of health  and development promoting leadership behavior  the health  and de  velopment friendly leadership analysis  which assesses followers  per  ceptions of leader behavior that have an influence on follower job de  mands  task requirements  and resources  jiménez and colleagues have developed a measure of health pro   moting leadership behaviors    in addition to this  earlier work by jiménez has conceptualized a  healthy leadership  style  which refers to    humane and relationship oriented leading with  sic  focus on the subjective well being of employees and man  agers     although conceptualized as a unique style of leadership   healthy leadership  is measured by jiménez et al    with a scale of attitudes and beha  viors regarding  healthy leadership     more recently  dellve and eriksson   offered a model of health   promoting managerial work  defined as evidence based knowledge of health promoting psychosocial work conditions  as well as the cap  ability to apply  adapt  and craft sustainable work practices  this sys  tems based model was developed to support the design and im  plementation of training programs to support leaders  enactment of workplace health promotion programs  finally  the concept of salutogenic leadership derives from the sys   temic salutogenic interaction model    the ssim aims to extend earlier work on health oriented leadership by developing a holistic framework in which health promoting interac  tions are the focus  and where dynamics in such interactions are af  fected both by leaders and followers  eberz and antoni   argue that such interactions are neglected by health oriented leadership models  and that the reciprocal influences between follower health and leader health must be accounted for  additionally  the ssim suggests that a sense of coherence   is the mechanism by which health supportive leadership exerts its positive influence  and that the effect of such leadership is bound by contextual factors and the health promoting interactions between lea  ders and their subordinates  to complement the ssim  eberz and antoni   developed the trust  incident management  and pressure   inventory as an index of the core facets of salutogenic leadership   comparison of different  healthy leadership  theoretical frameworks  given the number and diversity of  healthy leadership  models  it is difficult to make absolute comparisons  these models have each been developed using different methods  and for different reasons and pur  poses  that said  there are some common  either explicit or implicit  assumptions present across these models  in terms of explicit assump  tions  each of these models of  healthy leadership  claims that there are observable differences in leaders  values  attitudes  and or behaviors that support follower health and wellbeing  across models it is assumed that it is possible to improve these values  attitudes  and behaviors  corollary to this  it is assumed that developing  healthy leadership  is important for workplace health promotion  finally   healthy leader  ship  is assumed to be a meso level component of health promotion  which serves as a  bridge  between organizational level health  c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             promotion policies and practices and individual level   health and wellbeing  although some models of  healthy leadership  posit a reciprocal relationship between leaders and followers that is mutually beneficial    this idea is less universal across models  and as we will see from our review  is rarely if ever rigorously tested  considering these common explicit assumptions  it should be clear  that there is a great deal of conceptual overlap between models of  healthy leadership   the co occurrence of so many similar models within this literature is concerning  particularly if they are assumed to operate independently of one another    we would argue that there is a great deal of commonality between these various models  perhaps more so then there are differences  that said  only a few studies have measured multiple  healthy leadership  constructs simulta  neously  however  those few studies find notable overlaps  suggesting the possibility of redundancy    models of  healthy leadership  likewise make two implicit as   sumptions  owing to their unstated nature  two related issues emerge when considering these implicit assumptions  first  these two assump  tions are rarely tested in primary research  second  if these assumptions did not hold up to empirical scrutiny  then the utility of these models for explaining occupational health and wellbeing would be quite lim  ited  the first assumption is that the various conceptualizations of  healthy leadership  serve as stand alone constructs  that is   healthy leadership  is assumed to operate independently and incrementally to other forms of leadership  and particularly to the benefit of employee health and wellbeing  for example  one argument for the development of  healthy leadership  models  is that established and general models of leadership behavior or leader follower relations   are too broad and do not tap specific health  related actions of leaders    although offered as justification  this proposition remains largely un  tested in the literature  as models of  healthy leadership  are rarely compared to established leadership theories  and when such tests are offered  they are rarely conducted with sufficient rigor to rule out other plausible explanations  in contrast  researchers have argued that new leadership models need to demonstrate incremental validity in pre  dicting outcomes  above and beyond established leadership constructs    to this end  eberz and antoni   report zero  order correlations between their timp inventory and individualized consideration as high as rxy      the second assumption of these models is that  healthy leadership   is separable from the outcomes that it purports to influence  in other words   healthy leadership  behaviors are assumed to be distinct and un confounded with their intended consequences    raising questions regarding this assumption is perhaps an artifact of the fact that early models of  healthy leadership  were inductively developed    however  the idea that there is a reciprocity between leader and follower health is likewise sympto  matic of this confounding  for example  the  self care  and  staff care  distinction made by franke and felfe s   model of health oriented leadership conflates leaders  health behaviors   with followers  perceptions of their leader s health behaviors directed toward them    and with followers  self reports of their health behaviors    further examples of such confounding can be seen in the ssim  model by eberz and antoni   and in the conceptualization of health  and development promoting leadership behavior by vincent    the ssim depicts a complex  cyclical process  wherein leader  and follower health are dynamically intertwined with health related cognitions  goals  and emotions of both leaders and followers  with consequent effects on leader and follower sense of coherence  although the ssim model conflates leader and follower outcomes in its con  ceptualization  the operationalization of  healthy leadership  via the timp measure focuses on general leader behaviors surrounding trust  error management  and work pressure  without reference to health  the  health  component of this model is conceived as leader and follower sense of coherence  thus  the consequence of  healthy leadership  is understood by the influence that these general leadership behaviors have on sense of coherence  similarly  the vincent   scale of health  and development promoting leadership behavior measures   general leader behaviors that are not health specific per se    evidence for  healthy leadership  is informed by the re  lationship of these variables with follower reported health outcomes    as with the ssim  the consequence of  healthy leadership  is taken as evidence for its existence  in a broader sense  there is a mismatch between the way these  constructs are defined and their specific operationalizations  fundamentally  this is a content validity issue that has clear bearing on the construct validity of operationalizations of  healthy leadership   and the models that construe them  also contributing to these concerns about confounding  a majority of studies that purport to study  healthy leadership  in one form or another rely on single time point  single  source   methodologies    as we will see from our review  prototypically  such studies survey fol  lowers about their perceptions of their leader s capacity for  healthy leadership  concurrently with self reported health and wellbeing  this raises concerns about common source common method bias  a statis  tical artifact which can unduly inflate such relationships     review of empirical studies on  healthy leadership   our literature review focuses on empirical  quantitative and quali  tative studies of  healthy leadership  and health related outcomes for employees    we undertook a systematic approach to lit  erature searching    we next describe the methods and results of this review effort  fig    sum  marizes the process undertaken here   method  we set a number of a priori inclusion exclusion criteria  the pri  mary inclusion criterion for quantitative studies is that the studies must have considered both an explicit operationalization of at least one  healthy leadership  construct   and at least one relevant so  matic    subjective health    and or psychological health wellbeing   outcome  applying this criterion means that studies that only considered re  lationships between established and more general leadership constructs   and such health and wellbeing outcomes were excluded  unless the joint influence of  healthy leadership  was assessed concurrently with these constructs  such that comparisons in predictive validity could be made directly    to be comprehensive  we also considered qualitative studies of  healthy leadership    that clearly delineate the influence of  healthy leadership  on follower health  c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             outcomes  as well as studies that focus on  healthy leadership    and its associations with health and wellbeing outcomes for leaders themselves    to obtain studies that met these criteria  we conducted compre   hensive literature searches using several strategies  first  we searched psycinfo  web of science  google scholar  and pubmed  using a series of iterative and structured keyword searches corresponding to the con  structs discussed above    beyond keyword searches via search engines and databases  we  conducted forward and backward searches of highly cited sources al  ready identified by our primary literature review  we also skimmed the reference sections of relevant review papers   and forward searched early theory development papers    we took additional steps to obtain unpublished studies for consideration in our review  including searching for and considering relevant theses dissertations and conference papers  of note  when both published and unpublished versions of a study were identified  we retained only the version which reported more information    this process resulted in k   sources for potential inclusion in  our literature review  for each search  we exported all records and saved them to a database  after removing duplicate references  our database included k   non redundant sources  the first and second authors then met and screened titles and abstracts of these sources for obvious exclusions    this process resulted in the exclusion of k   studies from our database  the remaining k   studies were then subjected to a more in depth full text screening for inclusion in our review  to accomplish this  the first and second author met again and collabora  tively screened full texts for each of these sources  applying the afore  mentioned inclusion exclusion criteria  ultimately  these combined efforts resulted in k    studies that were retained for our review  fig    presents a flowchart of this literature search process and table   summarizes the studies included in our review   results  in this section  we present the results of our review of the k    studies that we identified through our systematic search of the  healthy leadership  literature    we organize our review around the various  healthy leadership  constructs under investigation in these studies  moreover  within each construct grouping  we present studies in chronological order    unless otherwise noted  as we have already stated  a great deal of ambiguity emerges when con  sidering the labeling of  healthy leadership  constructs in this litera  ture  for example  we often observed that studies claim to investigate one particular form of  healthy leadership   but measure a different  fig     flowchart of literature search process   c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             form  in organizing our review  we have characterized these constructs in line with the authors  original intentions and point out any confusion that may arise from such decisions  also  our review found several studies that considered multiple measures of different  healthy lea  dership  constructs    to account for such studies  we focus our review on the primary construct of in  terest within each study  when a secondary  healthy leadership  con  struct was also measured    we only review the study once  and within the section that corresponds to the primary  healthy leadership  construct of interest   health promoting leadership by far  the most frequently studied  healthy leadership  construct  identified in our literature review was health promoting leadership  we identified   studies adopting a quantitative approach to studying health promoting leadership  and five studies adopting a qualitative approach   quantitative studies of health promoting leadership  in a conference paper  gurt and elke   used a two wave complete panel survey design to study the relationship between employee reported health promoting leadership and strain across a six month interval  considering zero  order relationships  health promoting leadership was negatively  albeit weakly  related to strain at both time     and time      moreover  a structural equation model was specified to test the concurrent and time lagged indirect effect of health promoting leadership on follower strain through a measure of subjective health culture  only the results of a fully mediated model are reported  and estimates of indirect effects and associated inferential tests are not offered  thus  it is difficult to understand the nature of the indirect relationship modeled here  in an unpublished thesis  törnblom   investigated relation   ships between employee reported health promoting leadership and health status using a cross sectional design  the zero order relationship between health promoting leadership and self reported health status suggests a small  positive relationship    however  when construed together with transformational leadership in a multiple re  gression model  the partial regression coefficient representing this re  lationship is negative    this can be explained by the ob  servation that transformational leadership and health promoting leadership were correlated with each other at rxy      making these largely redundant   predictors  in an unpublished work  andersson and dafteke   report the  results of a cross sectional survey study  a significant zero order re  lationship between employee reported health promoting leadership and an index composed of job satisfaction  development opportunities  health  wellbeing  and emotional requirements was reported    winkler et al    conducted a cross sectional study with surveys  collected from followers and their leaders  given the nested structure of the data  four separate mixed effects models were considered for each health outcome  main effect relationships between the four employee  reported health promoting leadership measures and follower health outcomes were inconsistent  with several relationships evaluated at the p      level of statistical significance  in a cross sectional survey study  adler et al    investigated  work related factors  including both  general  and health promoting leadership  that are associated with burnout among u s  military medical personnel  considering zero order relationships  follower re  ported health promoting leadership was negatively associated with burnout  ptsd symptoms  and perceived stressors  dimensions of burnout were considered further in two hierarchical multiple regression models  wherein health promoting leadership was found to explain incremental variance of δr        and      in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization  respectively  above and beyond covariates   general leadership  ptsd symptoms  and stressors  additionally  we identified six studies of health promoting leader   ship by jiménez and colleagues  given similarities across these studies  we review them as a set  first  in an unpublished conference paper  jiménez and dunkl   report two studies linking their measure of health promoting leadership conditions to follower health outcomes  both studies adopt cross sectional survey designs  considering zero  order correlations  the first study suggests that health promoting lea  dership is positively associated with stress related recovery  the results of the second study suggest a similar positive relationship with work engagement  dunkl  jiménez  žižek  milfelner  and kallus   investigated  relationships among health promoting leadership  transformational leadership  and followers  recovery and perceived stress  the results of a structural equation model indicate that health promoting leadership and transformational leadership are moderately correlated with one  another    moreover  both health promoting leadership and transformational leadership had independent  positive relationships with recovery  but not with perceived stress  variance explained   estimates were not provided  so it is difficult to gauge the relative ex  planatory capacity of health promoting leadership versus transforma  tional leadership from this study  in an unpublished conference paper  bregenzer  jiménez  and kallus    present the results of a two wave incomplete panel study across a six month interval that investigated effects of health promoting lea  dership on follower burnout  perceived stress  and recovery  at time    employees rated their supervisors  health promoting leadership condi  tions  at time    they reported their burnout  perceived stress  and recovery  separate multiple regression models were specified for each health outcome  the models suggested that  of the seven dimensions assessed by the health promoting leadership conditions scale  only the  control  dimension was consistently related to outcomes    inconsistent and  for the most part  non sig  nificant relationships were observed for the other dimensions  additionally  because an incomplete panel design was used  these data are essentially cross sectional in nature  thus  it is unclear from this study whether health promoting leadership affects changes in follower health over time  jiménez  winkler  and dunkl   considered leaders  self as   sessment of their own health promoting leadership conditions  leaders rated their own health promoting leadership   and health oriented leadership using franke et al  s   measure  leaders also self reported their own levels of recovery  perceived stress  and burnout  of note  only zero order correlations are reported  so it is difficult to compare the relative operation of the two  healthy leader  ship  scales against one another  however  these correlations suggest a degree of overlapping variance between these two different scales    that said  a general pattern across correlations suggests that health promoting lea  dership is associated positively with recovery and negatively with perceived stress and burnout  similarly  but among followers  jiménez  winkler  and bregenzer    investigated relationships between health promoting leadership conditions  health oriented leadership  and health outcomes  including perceived stress  recovery  and burnout  only zero order correlations are reported for this study  so it is not possible to compare the relative operation of the two  healthy leadership  scales  however  the corre  lations presented suggest a degree of overlapping variance between these two different scales    the general pattern again suggests that health promoting leadership is associated positively with recovery and negatively with perceived stress and burnout  lastly  jiménez  bregenzer  kallus  et al    examined the re   lationship between health promoting leadership and follower recovery   c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             perceived stress  and burnout in two samples of workers who were surveyed as part of a cross sectional research design  as before  the pattern of zero order relationships reported suggests that health pro  moting leadership is associated positively with recovery  and negatively with perceived stress and burnout  despite the limitations of the cross  sectional design adopted here  complex structural equation models were tested  specifying causal linkages between health promoting lea  dership  recovery  stress  and burnout  such models were fit separately in both samples  direct relationships between health promoting lea  dership and recovery and stress were simultaneously specified in both models  in each  health promoting leadership was positively associated with recovery  but not associated with stress  in contrast  direct re  lationships between health promoting leadership and burnout were not explicitly modeled here   qualitative studies of health promoting leadership  eriksson  axelsson  and axelsson   report the evaluation results of a leadership development program  the immediate goal of the intervention was to support the development of health promoting leadership  with a longer  term goal to reduce sickness absence rates among followers  follower health outcomes were only indirectly inferred  on the basis of leaders  responses to semi structured interviews  which represented the evaluation of the intervention s effectiveness  one of the products of the intervention was that leaders were tasked with developing  action plans  for initiating  structuring  and monitoring health promotion efforts in their workgroups  some leaders  plans included provisions to analyze sickness rates and work attendance together with their followers  juhlin   conducted semi structured interviews with leaders in  a  major organization   the interview asked these leaders to describe various ways in which they had enacted health promoting leadership  generally organized around themes of accessibility  commitment  con  text  and control in their role and specifically in relation to followers  health  the influence of health promoting leadership on follower health was inferred from leaders  responses to such questions  for example  leaders variously mentioned that they consciously rotate employees across job duties  particularly those which are strenuous  as a means of reducing workload and mitigating fatigue associated with repetitive and or strenuous tasks  winkler  busch  and duresso   investigated health promoting  leadership behavior through semi structured interviews with em  ployees and managers  the interviews asked questions surrounding general leadership behaviors  resource  and development promoting aspects of leadership  the role of leaders in stress management  and the role of leadership for influencing health  an interesting observation from this study is that followers often did not see the connection be  tween their leader s behavior and their own health  or did not ne  cessarily desire for such a link to exist  in an unpublished thesis  pärlemyr   describes the results of a  qualitative investigation of health promoting leadership  conducted via semi structured interviews with private sector leaders  responses to these interviews were subjected to a manifest content analysis  from which various themes emerged representing leaders  perceptions of the importance of their behavior for their followers  health  the influence of health promoting leadership on follower health outcomes was inferred from leaders  responses    finally  furunes  kaltveit  and akerjordet   conducted a qua   litative study with nurses to study the attributes of health promoting leaders that are associated with health outcomes for followers  the influence of health promoting leadership was inferred from responses to semi structured interviews  the results suggest that certain actions on the part of leaders influence indicators of follower wellbeing  in particular  nurses reported that behaviors of leaders that convey the meaningfulness of their work were particularly health promoting   health oriented leadership six studies were identified that conceptualized  healthy leadership   in terms of health oriented leadership  five such studies adopt a quantitative methodology  relying on the health oriented leadership scale developed by franke and colleagues    the final study identified used a qualitative methodology  grounded within the broader idea of health oriented leadership  first  a book chapter by franke and felfe   provides an  overview of the development of their health oriented leadership scale  in addition  they offer the results of a two wave incomplete panel study conducted across four months  with data collected from both leaders and followers  from the description  it is not clear whether these lea  ders and followers were matched with one another  however  the single level analyses presented seem to suggest they are not  along with health oriented leadership  a measure of followers  health promoting behaviors  and two follower health outcomes   irritation and somatic complaints   were collected  ambiguities regarding levels of analysis notwithstanding  a time lagged mediation model is presented and evi  dence is provided to suggest that followers  health promoting behavior mediates the relationship between health oriented leadership and health outcomes  franke et al    present further evidence for the usefulness of  their measure of health oriented leadership in two studies  the first study is based upon a slightly larger sample of employees that pre  dominantly overlaps with franke and felfe s   construct valida  tion effort  reported above  no follower health outcomes were reported in this first study  however  the second study used an incomplete panel survey design  with health oriented leadership   collected at time    and follower health out  comes   collected at time    at time    a measure of transformational leadership was also collected  in a series of hierarchical regression models  health oriented leadership dimensions accounted for incremental variance in follower health outcomes above and beyond transformational leadership  ex  plaining between δr      to    additional variance  in one of the few multi level multi source studies identified   kranabetter and niessen   surveyed leaders and their followers from two different organizations using a cross sectional research de  sign  cross level correlations suggest that leaders  health oriented lea  dership was not related to their followers  exhaustion or cynicism  however  in a series of hierarchical mixed effects models  health or  iented leadership was found to moderate the relationship between transformational leadership and both of these follower health out  comes  such that  higher  health oriented leadership augmented the otherwise negative relationship between transformational leadership and both exhaustion and cynicism  regarding incremental effects  health oriented leadership was only found to be incrementally related to exhaustion  and only in one company  estimates of the variance explained by these models are not provided  so it is difficult to ascertain the magnitude of these relationships  a study by santa maria  wolter  gusy  kleiber  and renneberg    examined health oriented leadership in the context of police work  using a cross sectional survey design  this study investigated relationships between health oriented leadership  work related health behaviors  and health outcomes  including physical complaints  burnout  depression  and wellbeing  zero order results and a structural equation model suggest that health oriented leadership is positively associated with work related health behaviors and wellbeing  and ne  gatively associated with physical complaints  burnout  and depression  in another multi wave multi source study  köppe et al    in   vestigated how health oriented leadership behavior serves as a me  chanism linking the crossover effects of leaders  exhaustion to followers  somatic complaints  the study used an incomplete two wave panel design  and a sample of leaders paired with one or two of their fol  lowers  leaders reported their exhaustion at time    three months  c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             later  at time    followers rated their leaders  health oriented leadership behavior    and their own somatic health complaints  no direct effect of leaders  exhaustion on employees  somatic complaints was observed  however  there was a significant indirect effect  in that leaders  exhaustion influenced somatic complaints through employees  assessments of leaders   staff care  behavior  finally  a qualitative study by kranabetter and niessen   in   vestigated leaders  behavioral responses to exhausted employees  and perceptions of how these responses contribute to reductions in ex  haustion in a sample of managers  grounded in the concept of health  oriented leadership    leadership behaviors that represent how man  agers engage with exhausted employees were identified through structured interviews  interviewees were also asked to report  in their opinion  which of these behaviors contributed most toward reducing exhaustion  among these behaviors  task  design and emotional support were reported as being most efficacious in this regard  with respect to other models of leadership  kranabetter and niessen also report that   of these behaviors could be mapped onto similar beha  viors that define either transformational leadership or individualized consideration and initiating structure   health  and development promoting leadership we identified four studies that conceptualized  healthy leadership   as health  and development promoting leadership  first  vincent   present the results of scale development efforts surrounding the  health  and development friendly leadership analysis   unfortunately  incomplete results are presented  however  a brief summary of multiple regression analyses is provided  wherein follower health outcomes were individually regressed onto the health  and development friendly lea  dership analysis and transformational leadership  simultaneously  from this summary  health  and development promoting leadership seem to explain variance in these outcomes incremental to transformational leadership  accounting for between δr     to    additional var  iance across the outcomes considered  vincent   adopted a similar approach to vincent    by  considering a cross sectional sample collected from employees working in a variety of sectors  only zero order relationships are reported  thus  it is not possible to directly evaluate the relative contributions of dif  ferent leadership measures collected for explaining variation in fol  lower health  that said  there was an expected pattern of zero order relationships present in these data  such that health  and development  promoting leadership was positively associated with work engagement  and negatively associated with irritation and emotional exhaustion  it should also be noted that a similar pattern of relationships was ob  served for support oriented leadership  adopting a similar design  measurement  and analysis strategy to  the preceding two studies  vincent    collected a cross sectional sample of employees  considering incremental effects  health  and de  velopment promoting leadership explained variance in irritation  emotional exhaustion  and psychosomatic health complaints above and beyond transformational leadership and support oriented leadership  explaining between δr     to    additional variance  finally  a report by rigotti et al    presents results of the   rewarding and sustainable health promoting leadership  project  first  in a cross sectional pilot study  only zero order relationships are re  ported  so it is not possible to ascertain the relative contributions of health  and development promoting leadership against these other leadership constructs  that said  these relationships suggest that health  and development promoting leadership is associated with follower health in the expected direction for all outcomes  with the exception of somatic problems for which no association was observed  second  the  main study  reported by rigotti et al    presents the results of both a three wave incomplete panel survey study of leaders and their followers  and an intervention study  the intervention  in which a subset of the total sample participated  was a leadership development program designed to enhance rewarding and health supporting  leadership behavior  the intervention took place during multiple ses  sions over two years  and involved a combination of lectures  team  based workshops  coaching  and diary writing  the results of this in  tervention provided weak and mixed results for its capacity to enhance health  and development promoting leadership behaviors and follower health  with several relationships gauged against a p      standard  regarding results from the survey component of this study  only  responses from  control group  followers   were considered  regression models are reported for a subset of the available health outcomes noted above  considering time   to time   relationships  constituting a lag of    months  health  and development promoting leadership accounted for a significant amount of variance in work engagement  exhaustion  ir  ritation  somatic stress  and depression  incremental models were also tested  for certain combinations of other leadership variables    however  such predictors were only included in these models if they exhibited statistically significant zero order correlations with the outcome  accordingly  the most comprehensive   conclusion to be drawn here is that health  and development promoting leadership accounts for incremental variance in work engagement  exhaustion  and depressive symptoms  above and beyond transformational and authentic leader  ship  these incremental relationships are observed without controlling for baseline   levels of corresponding outcomes  so these otherwise longitudinal relationships are understood to be essentially cross sectional in nature   additional  healthy leadership  models although most studies identified as part of our literature search  efforts could be classified as examining health promoting  health or  iented  or health  and development promoting leadership  we identified a number of other  related conceptualizations of  healthy leadership    health specific leadership two studies we identified focus on health specific leadership  first   gurt et al    surveyed a sample of employees  and report zero  order correlations that suggest that both  general  and health specific leadership are positively related to job satisfaction  and negatively re  lated to strain  moreover  a complex partial mediation model was tested using cross sectional data  complete parameter estimates are not re  ported  thus  it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the relative predictive capacities of  general  and health specific leader  ship  that said  the zero order effects of  general  leadership appear to be of a higher magnitude than those of health specific leadership  second  horstmann   presents two studies as part of a dis   sertation that investigated relationships between health specific lea  dership and follower health  in the first study  zero order results suggest that health specific leadership is negatively associated with health complaints  additionally  even though a cross sectional design was employed  a complex multiple mediator model was tested  wherein health specific leadership was associated with health complaints through social resources and demands  despite the limitations of in  ferences from such a model  at the very least  these results suggest that health specific leadership has an incremental relationship with health complaints  insomuch as it explains variance above and beyond social resources and demands  however  δr  estimates are not reported herein  making it difficult to judge the strength of this incremental ef  fect  in the second study  another cross sectional survey design was  employed  zero order relationships suggest that health specific leader  ship is positively associated with  self care   and negatively with burnout  despite the cross sectional design  a multilevel moderated  mediation model was also tested  accounting for the nesting of re  spondents within participating geriatric care facilities  this model specifically tested whether personal initiative           behavior  moderates the indirect effect of health specific leadership on burnout through  self care   moderation results suggest that higher levels of personal initiative enhance the positive relationship between health specific leadership and  self care   moreover  from the para  meters considered in this mediation model  we can infer that health  specific leadership predicts   burnout incremental to the influ  ence of  self care   however  because estimates of δr  are not provided  it is challenging to ascertain the strength of this effect   healthy leadership although we have used the phrase  healthy leadership  to generally  characterize this entire literature  we did identify one study that con  ceptualized healthy leadership as a distinct construct using this label  specifically  an unpublished conference paper by möltner  benkhofer  and hülsbeck   studied healthy leadership  and its health related correlates  in terms of leader health outcomes  this study reports that leaders with higher levels of both health promoting employee leader  ship and self management reported higher levels of  mindfulness  and more positive health cultures in their organizations   leadership support for health promotion we identified two studies that conceptualized  healthy leadership   in terms of leadership support for health promotion  first  in a multi  source study  milner et al    investigated the relationship between leadership support for health promotion and employee wellbeing out  comes  despite the cross sectional nature of these data  a serially mediated multilevel structural equation model was specified  with leadership support for health promotion indirectly affecting follower wellbeing through workplace health promotion programs and policies at the company level   and perceptions of company com  mitment to workplace health promotion at the follower level  although this model did not specify the direct relationship between leadership support for health promotion and employee wellbeing  the zero order cross level correlations between these variables suggests that they are not statistically significant  second  an unpublished dissertation by hoert   used a cross   sectional survey across four different organizations  in terms of zero  order relationships  leadership support for health promotion was cor  related in the expected directions with each of these health outcomes    however  in a series of multiple regression models where each health outcome was regressed onto leadership support for health pro  motion and perceived organizational health climate simultaneously  different patterns of relationships were observed  for example  per  ceived organizational health climate  but not leadership support for health promotion  was associated with higher job satisfaction  lower job stress  and higher work engagement  of note  the non independence that resulted from the nesting of employees within the four organiza  tions that were surveyed was not addressed   individual organizational leadership for health promotion our literature searches found one study that operationalized in   dividual organizational leadership for health promotion  specifically  barrett  plotnikoff  and raine   report on the results of a program evaluation effort surrounding a large scale  multi year health promo  tion program  only statistically significant predictors of each outcome are reported  however those that are reported indicate that certain fa  cets of organizational leadership for health promotion are associated with  better  follower health     salutogenic leadership we identified two studies of salutogenic leadership  of note  these  studies adopt quite different conceptualizations of the idea of saluto  genic leadership  first  axewill   describes salutogenic leadership  in line with the general concept of salutogenesis    a sample of managers were purposefully recruited to participate in structured interviews on the basis of having different levels of  healthy attendance   the degree of salutogenic leadership engaged in by each manager was ascertained from their responses  and compared to their healthy attendance rates  findings suggest that managers generally balanced production oriented versus salutogenic leadership styles  however  the manager deemed to have the  most  production oriented   leadership style also had the lowest rate of healthy attendance  second  eberz and antoni   report on the validation of the  trust  incident management  and pressure   inventory in two samples of working adults  the timp inventory was found to relate to sense of coherence  moreover  the predictive capacity of the timp in  ventory for explaining sense of coherence was found to be incremental to transformational leadership in the first sample and other  healthy leadership  constructs   in the second sample  in both samples  adding salutogenic leadership explained an additional δr      of the variance in sense of coherence   health promoting managerial work  one study identified through our literature searches  dellve and eriksson    operationalized  healthy leadership  as health pro  moting managerial work  this study reports cumulative results from six separate leadership training programs  and a mixed methods analysis of these program s  following a thematic analysis of responses to inter  views  results suggested that the training had a positive influence on leaders  broadening their perspectives and affording tangible tools for encouraging health promotion  regarding leader health outcomes  leaders also reported significant increases in the quality of their psy  chosocial work environments and increases in job satisfaction following their participation in the training program  these results came from a larger project  more fully elaborated on in an earlier unpublished report    of note  this report provides more complete details of the influence of the training program on follower health outcomes  taken from follow up surveys distributed to followers  regarding such outcomes  job satisfaction and vitality increased among those followers whose leaders were more en  gaged in the training program  likewise  the number of sickness ab  sences increased in workplaces where leaders were more engaged in the program   descriptive qualitative studies  finally  of note  our review suggests that most qualitative studies of  healthy leadership  adopt a phenomenological perspective  which is to say that they presuppose the existence of  and seek to understand  people s experiences with  healthy leadership     the qualitative studies identified through our literature searches largely represent descriptive efforts  and tend to be represented by very small samples    including a number of unpublished  primarily swedish  theses and dissertations    these studies are descriptive of  healthy leadership  in general  and primarily aim to describe what  healthy leadership  means to leaders themselves  without regard to its influence on followers    given that no ascertainable follower health out  comes are obtained or reported in such studies  they were otherwise disqualified from our main literature review   discussion  in this final section of the paper  we summarize the most important points of criticism regarding the research we reviewed above   c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             subsequently  we address the final goal of this paper by outlining an integrative research agenda including recommendations for  healthy leadership  theory development  empirical research  and practical ap  plications   summary of criticisms of research on  healthy leadership   our review of the  healthy leadership  literature  suggests nu  merous problems that limit the validity of conclusions that can be drawn from this research  we discuss these critiques here and sum  marize them in table    first  the literature on  healthy leadership  is prone to  jingle  and  jangle  fallacies  which entail the wrong as  sumptions that two constructs are the same because they have the same label    or that two very similar constructs are distinct because they have different labels    there are jingle fallacies in that a number of constructs in this literature have been labeled health promoting leadership    even though the con  tent of the measures used to operationalize these constructs is far less aligned than their similar names would suggest  at the same time  there are jangle fallacies in that several  healthy leadership  constructs do not include health  and even leadership specific items but  for example  items on fairness and control    other scales  such as salutogenic leadership    include items   that are very similar to those in  cluded in established leadership measures    thus  the positive effects of many  healthy leadership  constructs on follower health and wellbeing may be confounded by effects of beneficial job design characteristics and leadership constructs such as lmx quality and individualized consideration  the existence of similar  healthy leadership  conceptualizations also represents a case of construct pro  liferation    already a noted concern in the broader leadership  literature    second  the inductive development of many  healthy leadership   measures leads to ambiguity in terms of what they actually capture  for example  möltner  benkhofer  and hülsbeck   asked leaders what  healthy leadership  means to them personally  and the leaders them  selves identified attitudes  values  and behaviors that cut across several different  healthy leadership  models  related concerns include unclear procedures for scoring measures   and the open question of whether multidimensional measures should be included as separate main effects or as overall aggregate scores in statistical ana  lyses  third  much of the empirical research on  healthy leadership  suf   fers from methodological problems that are not unique to this area  but have been lamented in the broader literature on organizational beha  vior    most studies use single time point cross sectional and single source designs    raising concerns about common method bias and the confounding of leadership behaviors with their intended outcomes  additionally  most studies do not control for established leadership constructs  thus leaving open the question of whether  healthy lea  dership  constructs explain incremental variance in follower health and wellbeing   fourth  the reporting of results of empirical studies on  healthy leadership  often is cumbersome  for example  although several studies assessed control variables  they did not report unique variance ex  plained by  healthy leadership  constructs in follower outcomes  finally  we note that most conceptual and empirical works on  healthy leadership  have not adopted a critical approach when introducing new concepts or discussing research findings  researchers in this area seem to be rather convinced that  healthy leadership  is a distinct  more specific  and important construct that has unique and beneficial effects  compared to the goal of demonstrating the relevance of  healthy lea  dership   critical tests of theory often seem to take a backseat in this  table   summary of critiques levied against the  healthy leadership  literature   criticism of  healthy leadership  research   theory  description of criticism   relevant examples from existing literature  means of addressing criticism in future research  jingle fallacies the incorrect assumptions that two constructs are the same because they have the same label    empirically differentiate  healthy leadership  constructs from one another via content analyses and factor analysis models  jangle fallacies   construct proliferation the incorrect assumptions that two very similar constructs are distinct because they have different labels       empirically consolidate  healthy leadership  constructs from one another via content analyses and factor analysis models  unclear construct definitions and operationalizations  ambiguities in defining   and operationalizing   healthy leadership constructs    adopt more rigorous definitions of  healthy leadership  that do not rely on inductive inferences   clearly define  rules  for operationalizing  healthy leadership   confounding of  healthy leadership  behavior and its intended outcomes  the behaviors that defined  healthy leadership  are conflated with their intended influences on health and wellbeing outcomes      clearly differentiate those attitudes  values  and behaviors that are classified as  healthy leadership    separate the measurement of  healthy leadership  from its intended outcomes by collecting multi source data  poor methodology use of sub optimal research designs  that do not allow for unambiguous conclusions to be drawn      design observational studies that collect fully crossed and lagged  multi wave  and multisource data   design intervention studies that implement rct or rd designs  incomplete reporting of statistical models failing to report all necessary information to gauge the appropriateness of statistical conclusions      follow  best practices  for the reporting of statistical models    imprecise predictions derived from  healthy leadership  frameworks  existing  healthy leadership  frameworks do not lend themselves well to precise predictions    unify and integrated  healthy leadership  frameworks  and make specific provisions for testable assumptions to be gleaned therefrom   healthy leadership  measurement suffers from  phantom validation   an unsystematic approach to the development of measures of  healthy leadership  is apparent in this literature      adopt rigorous  best practices  for the development and construct validation of  healthy leadership  measures   conduct re validation studies of existing  healthy leadership  measures  risks associated with viewing  healthy leadership  as a panacea  overemphasizing the importance of  healthy leadership  risks neglecting structural impediments to health and wellbeing which could be more directly acted upon      adopt a critical perspective on the relative utility of  healthy leadership  against other systems  policies  and practices that may more directly influence health and wellbeing  c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             literature  like other leadership constructs  the promise of  healthy leadership  has an appealing  hook  that has drawn researchers in    there is an intuitive  appealing message underlying this literature   leaders can do  things  which directly in  fluence their followers  health and wellbeing  despite this enthusiasm  the state of this literature is too scattered and underdeveloped to warrant all of the attention that this concept has received  that said  we see a variety of opportunities to improve research in this area   a  new agenda  for theory development  research  and practice  based on the critiques outlined above  we offer a number of ac  tionable recommendations for future theoretical  empirical  and prac  tical work on  healthy leadership    recommendations for theory  development first and foremost  this area would benefit from enhanced theo   rizing regarding the nature of  healthy leadership  and clearer gui  dance regarding its   influences  in terms of theory  de  velopment  it is therefore important that scholars stop introducing additional  new and unique  healthy leadership  constructs and asso  ciated labels and instead focus on better understanding   developing  and integrating those that already exist   into a broader and unified  healthy leadership  theoretical framework  such a framework should clearly distinguish between leader attitudes  values  and beha  viors related to health and wellbeing  moreover  it would seem neces  sary to include multiple measurable dimensions within each of these categories    efforts at  developing a more unified  healthy leadership  theory  must also take steps to ensure that the predictions that follow from it are specific and testable  one general criticism against existing  healthy leadership  frameworks is that they do not offer precise predictions about the linkage between leaders  attitudes  values  and behaviors on the one hand  and associated favorable health and wellbeing outcomes on the other  moreover  such theories generally do not make predic  tions about the conditions that give rise to  healthy leadership   as suggested  the basic premise underlying the idea of  healthy leader  ship  is that  doing more  of it has a concomitant   positive influence on such outcomes  for example  considering the consequence of follower wellbeing  the common prediction would be   if leaders enact  healthy leadership   then the wellbeing of their em  ployees will improve     this prediction can be boiled down to a direct function  in which follower wellbeing is understood as a function of healthy leadership     ffollower wellbeing      it is this type of precise definition that is currently lacking in the theorizing concerning  healthy leadership   such functional predictions could also be extended to include health and wellbeing outcomes for leaders  as well as outcomes at different levels of analysis    to begin addressing the need for enhanced theory  we propose a  process model of  healthy leadership  to inform future work    given that many of the critiques levied here would need to be resolved before tests of this model could be reasonably attempted  we consider this to be a  speculative  model in the spirit of house s   theory of charismatic leadership  thus  we classify this as a    model of  healthy leadership    which we offer in the hope that   at some future date  this theory will have led to a better theory      in brief  the  core  of our proposed model suggests that  healthy leadership  components   influence follower and leader wellbeing outcomes both directly and indirectly    these effects are incremental to those of established lea  dership constructs   and work characteristics   that explain variance in follower and leader well  being  moreover  the effects of  healthy leadership  are likely moder  ated by leader individual differences and contextual conditions    beyond the core processes of the model  we pro  pose that relevant leader individual differences and contextual condi  tions have direct and interactive effects on  healthy leadership   and that follower and leader wellbeing directly and interactively influence more distal  objective and subjective work outcomes  although the need for enhanced theorizing is pressing  in order to  embark on tests of this model  there is a broader landscape of  healthy leadership  that must be mapped  we suggest that this mapping process must unfold in a systematic and ordered process  our suggestions here are geared toward expanding the simple functional relationship de  scribed above  as a means of expanding our understanding of  healthy leadership   much of the effort required to integrate and unify  healthy leadership  theory will be informed by a more rigorous research agenda   recommendations for empirical research fig    outlines a flowchart of the four steps involved in our proposed  research agenda and examples of research questions to ask at each step  our goal here is to provide prescriptive advice that  if followed  would advance our empirical understanding  while additionally serving the development of a more codified theory of  healthy leadership   where relevant  we provide guidance for the types of research designs and methodological concerns that are necessary to realize this research agenda   step one  the first step in this new research agenda   is to come to an understanding of how the multitude of  healthy leadership  constructs are related and how they can be differentiated from one another    we need to establish a better understanding of the construct domain of  healthy leadership   we need to define  what it is  and  what it is not   the sheer number of  healthy leadership  constructs that exist in this literature is a liability to its broader contributions to our understanding of leadership  and occupational health related phenomena  thus  the  jingle jangle  of  healthy leadership  has to be addressed explicitly  and this must be done before attempts to differentiate it from other constructs are considered  this can be done in a number of ways  for example  the overlap of these constructs can be addressed through a thorough content analysis of existing measures  which can be triangulated through factor analytic methods and clustering profile methodologies  particular attention must be paid to the construct validation of various measures of  healthy leadership  found in the literature    indeed  a notable critique that could be levied against the measurement of  healthy leadership   is that it suffers from what has been deemed  phantom validation    the practice of re using unvalidated measures across multiple studies  and justifying this practice via citing research that has used such unvalidated measures in the past    once a clearer understanding of the  healthy leadership  construct  domain is established  the next step is to further establish its nomolo  gical network through offering empirical evidence for convergent and divergent validity  beyond definitional concerns  evidence for con  vergent and divergent validity speaks to the heart of the notion of construct differentiation  to this end  it is especially important for re  search to address and eliminate the confounding of actual  healthy leadership  behaviors and their intended outcomes    specifically   healthy leadership  could be defined as leader behavior   that addresses follower health and wellbeing  but it should not be defined as behavior that per se has positive effects on these outcomes  overall  we believe that there is a place for  healthy leadership  behavior in the  c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             broader leadership theoretical space  but the coordinates of this space need to be mapped and articulated more clearly   step two  the second step in this new research agenda   would be to establish evidence for the incremental validity of  healthy leadership   this step will serve to additionally expand our  understanding of the construct space that defines  healthy leadership  by establishing the unique role that it plays in the prediction of relevant outcomes   above and beyond established leadership constructs  for example  it is essential that scholars establish whether  healthy leadership  should be construed as distinct from or integrated with established leadership constructs   fig     proposed model of  healthy leadership   note  dotted lines indicate moderation  arrows converging with circles indicate possible direct and interactive effects   fig     outline of steps in  new agenda  for research on  healthy leadership    c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             indeed   healthy leadership  could also be conceived as a specific behavioral outcome of high lmx quality     healthy leadership  could also be understood as a specific manifestation of the broader leadership style of individualized consideration  which involves leaders showing an awareness of and concern for their followers  health and wellbeing  beyond the incremental contributions of  healthy leadership   its  unique role in predicting health and wellbeing above and beyond other individual and organizational factors that promote these outcomes needs to be established  indeed  research as yet to widely consider  healthy leadership  effects incremental to established predictors of health and wellbeing at the individual level   or at the team and organizational levels    regardless if tested against existing leadership constructs  or other  individual or team and organizational factors  it is imperative that fu  ture studies of  healthy leadership  report its incremental predictive validity in terms of variance explained above and beyond these broader and better established constructs  these models should ideally be ex  amined using fully crossed and lagged longitudinal research designs that permit modeling temporal dynamics and allow for more appro  priate inferences about causality and mediation    additionally  to avoid pitfalls of common method bias  ratings of  healthy leadership  and health and wellbeing outcomes should come from different sources  ideally  to avoid rating biases   healthy leader  ship  behavior should be observed during leader follower interactions and coded using theory based  a priori established behavioral cate  gories     step three  the third step in this new research agenda   should be to explore causal and boundary mechanisms of the influences of  healthy leadership   research to establish direct and unconditional relationships between  healthy leadership  and health and wellbeing outcomes is useful for addressing the clarification of its construct space and nomological network  however  beyond such relationships  research needs to establish why and when  healthy leadership  effects manifest to influence health and wellbeing   why  questions concern mediating mechanisms  and because such  mechanisms imply a causal process  they are not easy to study  indeed  cross sectional and single time point designs  such as those that are typically used in  healthy leadership  research  are unsuitable to study causal mechanisms    moreover  as with many dynamic phenomena  there is the possibility for reciprocal mechanisms linking organization   leader   and follower  level processes and outcomes via reinforcing loops between leaders and followers  and the dynamic interplay within their work environments  for example  in a top down  cascading process  a  healthy organiza  tional climate  may foster  healthy leadership  which  in turn  affects follower health and wellbeing  from the bottom up  follower health and wellbeing may reinforce  healthy leadership  which  in the ag  gregate  could be construed as one index of a  healthy organizational climate   this implied dynamic and non recursive process may ap  proximate a  wellbeing spiral   making the specification of mediating mechanisms challenging and begging for research designs that can capture this implied dynamicity  moreover  multilevel designs that capture responses from top management  hr officers  supervisors  and subordinates would allow for the emergence of these processes to be studied   when  questions concern moderating mechanisms  and ask  for  whom    type research questions regarding the relative efficacy of  healthy leadership   because  when  questions concern conditional mechanisms  they are likewise difficult to study  however  given the assumed top down influences of  healthy leadership  on follower  health and wellbeing  it is feasible that there are a number of situational contingencies for its relative effectiveness  for example  although the vast majority of studies have focused on outcomes of  healthy leader  ship   future research could examine potential dispositional and con  textual factors as antecedents and or moderators of  healthy leader  ship   the findings of such research could have bearing for the development of  healthy leadership  across individuals  careers  regarding methodologies  we additionally suggest that scholars  move away from inductive and qualitative  and especially phenomen  ological approaches that generate various descriptions of  healthy leadership  to deductive and quantitative designs that rigorously ex  amine antecedents and consequences  as well as mediator and mod  erators of  healthy leadership   as suggested above  such efforts must also take into account effects of established leadership constructs  particularly  lmx quality and individualized consideration   step    the fourth step in this new research agenda   is to develop interventions to enhance  healthy leadership   example research questions to be addressed here include   by what means can  healthy leadership  be developed   and  does  healthy leadership  development have a positive influence on leader and follower health and wellbeing   in understanding the efficacy of such efforts  intervention studies should use randomized control trials to further bolster inferences about causality    absent the possibility of  true  randomization  researchers should consider adopting quasi experimental methods  including regression discontinuity designs  as a means of estimating treatment effects for  healthy leadership  interventions    these four  steps  provide a path forward for research on  healthy  leadership  that will enhance the quality and impact of this body of work  our hope is that research on  healthy leadership  will adopt a more critical focus guided by the principle of parsimony  as opposed to a more lenient  confirmatory approach in the design of studies  ana  lyses  reporting  and discussion  by adopting a sound empirical strategy  including a more rigorous focus on measurement and theoretical   development  the impact of this research will be greater   recommendations for practice regarding applications of  healthy leadership   our general advice  to organizational practitioners is that they should likewise adopt a critical attitude toward existing research on  healthy leadership   taking into account the limitations of this research with respect to theory  methods and  sometimes  unclear  selective  and uncritical re  porting of findings  the heterogeneous literature on  healthy leader  ship  is currently too inconclusive and plagued with conceptual and methodological problems to allow for more definite recommendations for leadership practice  importantly  we are not suggesting that leaders and organizations should ignore employees  health and wellbeing on the contrary  we only suspect that research in this area might run the risk of  reinventing the wheel   because follower health and wellbeing might already be  to some extent  addressed and influenced by estab  lished and more general forms of leadership behavior  we do see promise in the possibility for the assumed outcomes of   healthy leadership  to be a mechanism by which leadership effec  tiveness is gauged  for example  one metric of a leader s value to the organization   could be the health and wellbeing of their followers  the appeal of this idea  is that it would serve as a direct mandate for the duty of care principle  putting a higher degree of responsibility for ensuring follower health and wellbeing on leaders themselves  this is noteworthy in an era where the burden of maintaining one s wellbeing has shifted increasingly to the individual  rather than the institution  moreover  the impact of  healthy leadership  could to be gauged  against tangible behavioral   and economic metrics    these ideas beg further the question of whether we should  structure reward systems for leaders to promote  c w  rudolph  et al  the leadership quarterly             the application of  healthy leadership  behaviors  perhaps leaders should be held accountable for their followers  health and wellbeing  much like they would for their individual  bottom line   economic contributions  such questions raise an important  as of yet unlevied critique of  healthy leadership  in general  specifically  we have not directly addressed whether the fundamental premise of  healthy lea  dership  is itself a good thing for followers  leaders  their organizations  and society as a whole  like many phenomena  an overemphasis on the role of  healthy leadership  is accompanied by certain hazards asso  ciated with its popularity  putting the onus for follower health and wellbeing on leaders  shoulders risks the possibility for an  all we need is leadership   mentality to emerge  the risk here specifically being that  like any supposed panacea  this mentality holds up  healthy lea  dership  as a  cure all  remedy  but does nothing to change the systems that make work a detriment to employee health and wellbeing in the first place     conclusion  our review of research on  healthy leadership  literature con  tributes to leadership literature in at least three important ways  first  our conceptual overview and our systematic and critical review brings needed clarity to this burgeoning research topic  second  we argue that the multiplicity in  healthy leadership  models and constructs is a lia  bility rather than a strength of this literature  to be clear  we would not argue against the need to consider specific health related leader atti  tudes  values  and behaviors  necessarily  rather  very similar con  structs have been offered and adopted uncritically and without regard for the broader nomological network of leadership  we hope that our review and critique serves as a call for more careful theoretical and empirical elaborations about this general idea  finally  we have criti  cally evaluated existing research regarding the confounding of actual leadership behaviors and their intended outcomes  and we have as  sessed whether research has sufficiently addressed the issue of the in  cremental validity of  healthy leadership   based on these critical evaluations  we have outlined a set of prescriptive recommendations for theory development efforts  future research  and practical applications regarding  healthy leadership   we hope that our review will help scholars and practitioners critically assess the contributions of  healthy leadership  constructs  models  and assessments to the leadership lit  erature and organizational settings  respectively   references    adler  a  b   adrian  a  l   hemphill  m   scaro  n  h   sipos  m  l     thomas  j  l

processes that contribute to leaders  decision making and behavior  the traditional trait approach to under  standing leaders  underlying processing carries limitations and does not capture any of the situational char  acteristics that may be important  we thus advance the situation trait approach by introducing the cognitive affective processing systems framework more fully into the leadership domain  a primary benefit of integrating this framework is that it identifies an attribute largely overlooked by leadership scholars  yet foundational to leaders  processing and behaviors  situation

succeed in competitive environments    acknowledging this  a primary question researchers and practitioners face is   how do we improve the effectiveness of leaders   this is particularly important because anecdotal evidence suggests a large proportion of leaders are not operating as effectively as expected  gallup  inc  s polling research has revealed that only    of employees strongly agree that their performance is managed in a way that moti  vates them to do outstanding work    the center for creative leadership reports that over    of executives outright fail in the first   months    to answer the question   how do we im  prove the effectiveness of leaders   it is critical to understand the un  derlying processes that contribute to leaders  decision making and be  havior  only by diving into the psychology of leadership can we hope to comprehensively understand why leaders do what they do  which will  ultimately help us train leaders to process and behave in more effective and optimal ways   historically  the emphasis on why leaders do what they do has been on leaders  traits  this traditional approach implied that leaders  traits were the primary explanation for leaders  processing and behavior  and left organizations with two primary options if they wanted to improve the effectiveness of their leaders  select leaders with the traits more likely to lead to effectiveness or develop their leaders to possess such traits  unfortunately  this early approach carries three assumptions that have limited leadership development research and practice  these as  sumptions include    leadership behaviors are a function of relatively stable characteristics of the person      variability of behaviors across situations represent a form of measure  ment error or internal contradictions    and   the manifestation of the leader s traits and the situations they face are mutually exclusive and opposing influences    while leadership researchers have largely moved away from this tra  ditional focus of leaders  traits being the primary explanation for why leaders do what they do  these assumptions still linger and may be    received   november    received in

development of richer perspectives which can more com  prehensively explain leaders  processing and behavior   what psychologists and leadership researchers are increasingly agreeing on is that an improved explanation for why leaders do what they do must go beyond studying leaders  traits  and instead focus on the interaction of those traits with the specific situations in which leaders operate    they recognize that instead of the leaders operating similarly across situations because of their traits  leaders operate and manifest their traits differently across the various situations they encounter    for ex  ample  it should be expected for a leader who is generally high in agreeableness to demonstrate different levels of agreeableness across different situations for example one level when negotiating with em  ployees about where to hold the annual company retreat  and another level when negotiating a significant business deal  further  psycholo  gists do not believe that such variation should be considered  error   rather  such variation should be expected  and is likely predictable    thus  to better understand why leaders do what they do  we need to better understand the interplay between the situations leaders encounter and their traits    when we take this situation  trait approach  new and novel insights related to leadership develop  ment and effectiveness become apparent   perhaps the best framework to explain this situation trait approach is broadly summarized by a model and meta theory called  cognitive  affective processing system     the caps framework explains that how leaders operate in a given situation is based upon cues in the situation that activates select affect and cognitions within the leader    more specifically  it suggests that while individuals do not operate similarly across situations  they have processing and behavioral dispositions that become activated upon certain cues  causing them to operate similarly and predictably across situations that share similar cues    this framework identifies a commonly undervalued  yet critical aspect of leaders  operations  the initial intersection between the leader and the situations they encounter  which caps labels the  en  coding process      leaders  encoding process  which largely functions subconsciously  guides   what cues the leaders detect in the situations they encounter    why those particular cues are detected and not others  and   the activation of specific processing and behavioral dispositions  or re  peatable and predictable patterns  within the leaders  personality system    as such  leaders  encoding process are foundational to how they process and operate  and if categorized  can be used to develop a leader s  signature     we believe that if we can better understand leaders  encoding process  and the specific mechanisms that drive it    we will develop more precise leadership development guidance that involves a novel focus on leaders  encoding process  which has largely been absent from leadership research and practice   the purposes of our paper are three fold  first  we seek to shift consensus within the leadership literature to more fully embrace this situation trait approach in the study of why leaders do what they do  in doing so  we recognize that the leadership domain has historically placed emphasis on situational leadership theories  but  these theories have primarily focused on how leaders need to adapt to their situations instead of how their situations dictate their processing and behavior  which has only received scant attention  thus  we summarize the si  tuation trait approach  primarily relying upon the caps framework  our second purpose is to identify a component in this framework  leaders  encoding process  as being the most important and founda  tional component for leaders  operations because it initiates the inter  change between individual and situation and activates select aspects of leaders  personality systems   to  help them best navigate the situations they encounter  third  we review four sets of situation encoding schemas that govern leaders  encoding process  these schemas activate and guide leaders  processing and be  havioral dispositions  yet they have largely been overlooked by lea  dership researchers and practitioners  as such  they are ideal aspects to focus on for leadership development and promoting leadership effec  tiveness  one benefit of considering these sets of schemas together is that they can help identify leaders   signature  responses across the situations they encounter  with important developmental implications including enhancing their ability to be self aware  operate consciously    and engage in metacognition   the study of why leaders do what they do  the field of psychology has long investigated why people process and behave in the manner they do  historically  psychologists took two competing approaches  forming two branches of psychology  person  ality psychology and social psychology    personality psychologists focused on identifying internal traits to explain in  dividuals  processing and operation  on the other hand  social psy  chologists focused on the situational characteristics to explain in  dividuals  processing and operation  for many years  primarily in the  s and  s  these psychologists debated between the  power of the person  and  the power of the situation   considering the debate a zero sum formula  where it was all or nothing   psychologists  contemporary view is now a more accurate depiction of reality that acknowledges a combination of individual traits and si  tuational characteristics is what best explains why people operate the way they do  they believe that there is a dynamic interchange between situations and individuals  traits  and it is this interchange that best represents how individuals express their behavior    it is also an interchange that leadership scholars need to better integrate into their theories and re  search   the trait approach  the traditional approach that the leadership domain has taken in studying why leaders do what they do has been the trait approach  stemming from personality psychology    this approach has a long history that dates back to the ancient greeks who believed that some people had the  natures  to be leaders  while others did not    leadership researchers who have taken this approach have been primarily interested in identifying specific traits that can be generalized across situations  providing insight for leadership selection  development  and effectiveness  the significant amount of research on this topic has resulted in multiple meta analyses  allowing derue  nahrgang  wellman  and humphrey   to test a meta analytic structural equation model of the role leader traits play on leadership behaviors and effectiveness  they identified personality    intelligence  and gender as being the most heavily studied traits related to leadership   this approach carries an assumption that few have questioned  leaders  traits generally cause them to act the same across situations  unfortunately  this assumption  and broader approach  carries sig  nificant limitations  first  it views variability of behavior across situa  tions as error and internal contradictions    second  it construes personality and situation as being mutually ex  clusive and opposing influences    third  it overlooks and fails to address the psychological processes and dynamics that underlie leaders  behaviors    fourth  it fails to consider that leaders engage in cross situational consistent patterns of behavior that differ depending upon the cues of the situation    overall  this ap  proach ignores reality   the person and the situation at any given moment are inextricably interwoven               p      because of these limitations  the trait approach will al  ways be limited in its predictive validity of leadership effectiveness  and they are likely the primary reasons for relatively small correlations between traits and leader effectiveness     the situation trait approach  the leadership domain is increasingly recognizing the limitations associated with the traditional trait approach  but theoretical ap  proaches or frameworks that move the domain beyond this traditional approach have been slow to develop  fortunately  the psychological domain has spent decades studying how individuals  traits interact with their situation to explain why they do what they do  thus  there is much precedent and expected value from applying this situation trait ap  proach into the leadership domain  in fact  this approach has been predicted   and promoted   as a renaissance for the leadership domain   a framework commonly used to describe the situation trait ap  proach is caps    caps is a meta theory  which means that it provides a framework for building theories to account for individuals  characteristic intra individual behavior and the dynamics that underlie it    it is able to incorporate  the complexity of human per  sonality and the cognitive affective dynamics  conscious and un  conscious both  cool  and  hot   cognitive and emotional  rational and impulsive that underlie the individual s distinctive  characteristic in  ternal states and external behavioral expressions      the situation trait approach and caps framework takes a process  oriented perspective toward personality  viewing it as a process or system of a unique network of organized interconnections among cog  nitions and affects that explains why and when a leader behaves dis  tinctively    it moves beyond the idea that personality pro  duces uniformly consistent behavior across situations  and instead suggests that leaders possess various behavioral processes or patterns that are characteristic and predictable across situations  depending upon situational cues    it implies that certain traits   and related behavior may be utilized more heavily in situations with certain cues than other si  tuations with different cues   this approach carries its own assumptions that has unique im  plications for the leadership domain  first  leaders  context or situation has significant influence on the expression of their leadership    second  leaders  behavioral tendencies vary in stable and predictable manners across situational cues  which means that varia  bility in cognitions and behavior across situations is not viewed as error or internal contradictions  but as valuable information related to the leaders  personality processes    third  every leader will differ in how they encode the situations they encounter  and their specific encodings will activate their own unique pattern of processing and behavior    fourth  failed leadership is less about not possessing particular traits  and more about failing to encode their situations properly and subsequently failing to recognize the need to employ their traits dif  ferently across situations     comparing the situation trait approach to the trait approach  it becomes clear to see that while they are both seeking to address why leaders do what they do  they have different motives and focus  the trait approach seeks to identify the characteristics that explains how leaders are likely to operate across all situations  whereas the situation  trait approach investigates the psychological processes that underlie leaders  individual differences in behavior and its variability across si  tuations     this latter approach allows for a more accurate view of the reality of  human functioning  assuming variability in behavior across situations to be errors  the trait approach only offers flat  simplistic  static por  traits that characterize a leader s average types of behavior  instead  the situation trait approach sees variability to be part of the multi faceted nature of human character  and provides a richer  more comprehensive  and more coherent explanation and understanding of leaders  con  textualized behavioral expressions    it explains both baseline levels of behavior   and patterns of variability     it has been argued that the trait approach is akin to categorizing an automobile s dispositions    while that information may be helpful when determining which car to buy  it provides little value for fixing the car if it is not running properly  the situation trait approach  on the other hand  allows for a deeper understanding of what is going on  under the hood  the psychological processes and dynamics that underlie leaders  behavioral dispositions    when one has a knowledge of what is going on  under the hood   it makes one more capable of diagnosing and fixing any issues in operation   in fact  the situation trait approach allows for the identification of leader signatures or profiles representing their characteristic individual patterns of cognitions and behaviors in response to specific situational conditions    identifying and awaking to such signatures has valuable implications for enhancing leaders  self aware  ness and development  if leaders can better understand their processing dynamics  they will be able to more accurately assess and improve the effectiveness of their processing and operation    specifically  they will be able to anticipate the events and con  ditions that activate select signatures  allowing them to become more conscientious of the situations they step into and more conscious of their reactions and responses to such situations  altogether  they will be empowered to modify their processing that underlies any maladaptive and dysfunctional behaviors   modeling the situation trait approach  caps framework  the caps framework is the primary model used to capture the si  tuation trait approach  a depiction of this framework is presented in fig     broadly  it presents a process explaining why leaders operate the way they do   this process begins with the initial interaction between individual and situation  the situation is full of features and related cues  generally too many to process effectively  when individuals interact with the situation  they must identify and interpret a sample of select cues to start the process of informing the individual how to best navigate the situation  this is called the encoding process  this reading of the si  tuation occurs automatically  largely subconsciously  and efficiently     this encoding process activates a number of affective and cognitive personal aspects housed in what is broadly categorized as one s per  sonality system in a manner designed to help the individual best na  vigate the situation based upon the select cues perceived and how they are interpreted    mischel and shoda   identify five different categories of affective and cognitive personal aspects that can potentially be activated as part of the broad personality system  they include    encoders  which are people s in  dividualized manner of categorizing information from external stimuli    competencies and self regulation strategies  which include in  telligence and self regulatory strategies    expectancies and beliefs  or people s predictions about the consequences of each of the different behavioral possibilities    goals and values  which provide the basis for behavior consistency  and   affective responses  which include  r k  gottfredson and c s  reina the leadership quarterly             emotions  feelings  and the affects accompanying physiological reac  tions   the encoding process and subsequent pattern of affects and cogni  tions within the personality system serves to help individuals assign meaning to the situations they encounter  this system is complex  in  volving automatic bottom up processing  top down  hot    and  cold    information processing  and the five different personal aspects that range from volatile   to stable personal factors    altogether  this processing determines how individuals uniquely experience their situations and determines how they think  feel  and act  leading to the next step in the process  behavior generation  or taking action associated and in alignment with the initial encoding and subsequent processing within one s personality system   the caps framework also suggests that this sequence is circular  once the individual takes action as a result of their processing  the features of the situation can change or new cues can become available  restarting the encoding process  and reengaging the individual s per  sonality system  because of this cyclical relationship  individuals  pro  cessing interacts continuously and dynamically with the individuals  social world     the caps framework creates space for exploring and explaining the rich and dynamic processing that underlies leaders  responses to the situations they encounter  it includes allowing for the explanation for why a leader behaves differently across situations   to fully explore such processing and to improve our understanding of leaders  operations  there are two elements of the caps framework that are vital to understand  the personality system and the encoding process  we describe each as follows   personality system  a primary focus of the caps framework has always been on the description of the personality system  it creates a space for a variety of personal attributes to interact in a variety of ways in response to the cues encoded from the environment  explaining behavior across situa  tions and situational cues  the caps framework carries a number of assumptions about this personality system   first  it suggests that the affective and cognitive personal aspects interact in distinct patterns based upon the specific environmental cue encodings    these patterns generally operate in a distinct sequence  such that the immediate  triggering  of a specific attribute can in turn  trigger  other relevant aspects of the self    these patterns are processing structures that dictate  one s behavioral dispositions and subsequent behavior     second  it assumes that the complex  multifaceted relationships and interactions between these personal aspects may operate at many levels of awareness  automaticity  and control    mischel and shoda   state that the characteristic reactions of the personality system to situations are often immediate  non conscious  and automatic  but  the reactions can also be conscious and reflective  involving higher order cognitive processes  whether one reacts non  consciously or consciously may be partly described by the  heat  of the situation  when a situation is  hot   or emotionally charged  in  dividuals  personality system may operate more quickly and non con  sciously  but  when a situation is  cold   or emotionally neutral  in  dividuals  have the ability to be more contemplative  flexible  slow  and strategic  allowing for more conscious processing and regulation  other characteristics of the individual or situation that can affect the con  sciousness of one s processing system is the amount of stress within the individual or situation  the individual s developmental level  and the individual s self regulatory dynamics     third  it suggests that the personality system s patterns are stable across situations that share the same cues  specifically  these stable and predictable patterns are what characterize the personality of an in  dividual  and underlie their uniqueness     fourth  it suggests that while the structure of the personality system can remain stable across situations  it will change readily when the situational features change or are encoded differently    thus  the activated pattern of processing can be cate  gorized as an individuals  personality state  and as environments change  different personality states are activated    this implies that at any single point in time  only a portion of the individual s self construct is active  and as different cues are perceived  other portions of the individuals  self construct become active     fifth  it suggests that individual s variability in processing and be  havior across situations are not necessarily internal contradictions  ra  ther potentially predictable expressions of a stable underlying system that may remain unchanged in its organization    this provides the rationale for why  despite having certain stable traits    individuals do not operate similarly across situations    but operate similarly across situational cues     sixth  each individual s personality structure is both stable and un  ique  allowing for the explanation for why individuals with similar traits operate differently across the same situations  specifically  this difference can be explained by the chronic availability and ease of ac  tivation of particular affects and cognitions and the particular relations  fig     model of cognitive and affecting processing system   enc   encoding  srs   self regulatory strategies  exp   expectancies  gv   goals and values  aff   affects  adapted from mischel   shoda     p       r k  gottfredson and c s  reina the leadership quarterly             among them    seventh  as individuals  repeatedly use and rely upon specific pro   cessing patterns  they increase in strength  and may even function more automatically and habitually over time    in fact  lord  diefendorff  schmidt  and hall   suggest that it is common for leaders to nonconsciously rely on these habitual processing patterns for their functioning and operation   together  these assumptions have led mischel   to summarize the caps framework as follows    the caps model is idiographic in the sense that it is about each person s distinctive organization and how it is expressed in inter  actions with the social world  but while intended to capture the uniqueness of each personality  it is not limited to n      it lends itself easily to the nomothetic study of types of people who share common if      then      behavioral signatures  and similar underlying processing dynamics  generated by similarities in their caps net  works      mischel is alluding to the idea that the personality system is the  nuts and bolts  of the of the caps framework  but  he is also sug  gesting that if we can better understand and predict why certain pat  terns or systems will be activated  we can better predict individuals  processing and subsequent behavior    this leads us to the aspect of the caps framework that we are most interested in  the encoding process  which is the intersecting point between the individual and the situation   encoding process  across mischel and shoda s   explanations of the caps framework  and relative to their explanation of the personality system  the encoding process has received relatively little attention  yet  it is a critical aspect of explaining why leaders do what they do  this is for two primary reasons  first  it initiates the behavioral process  in order for leaders to effectively navigate the situations they encounter  they must first form situational impressions    since it is extremely inefficient  costly  and time consuming to process every possible situational cue  individuals quickly attend to  filter  and interpret only the information that appears salient  important  and consequential    second  and consequently  the cues that are attended to  filtered  and interpreted are what activates individuals  personality system in ways unique to the filtered cues     mischel and shoda   generally identify the encoding process as if  then  situation behavior relations  they suggest that if certain cues are identified  then specific personality signatures are ac  tivated  more specifically  the encoding process guides and constrains the particular patterns of affect and cognitions within the personality system    as such  the encoding process un  derlies and is foundational to how individuals think  process  and cor  respondingly behave   there are two important features of this process to point out  first  encoding is what brings meaning to an environment   what is hap  pening  what might have led to the observed state of affairs  and what might happen    the objects and the aspects associated with an environment are neutral and without meaning  they only take on meaning once they are perceived by an individual  for example  a picture of a clown  if unobserved  does not carry any meaning  but  if observed  can bring a variety of emotions and cognitions ranging from amused to fear  second  this encoding process generally occurs automatically and outside of one s awareness    the purpose of this automatic and non con  scious meaning making process is to quickly inform processing  reg  ulation  and behavior based upon the situational cues     the encoding process is primarily regulated by individuals   categories for the self  people  events  and situations  which mischel and shoda   label as  encodings   we label them as situation encoding schemas   broadly  schemas have been described as patterns of thought that influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge to quickly understand one s world    they are the lenses through which individuals interpret information and translate it into actions     such descriptions seemed to be aligned with the  encodings  mischel and shoda   describe  which   explain why individuals differ in how they selectively focus on different cues and features in a given situation    initiate and activate the personality system  and   continue to interact with other aspects of the wider personality system to determine appropriate behavior in response to the situation  we add the label   situation encoding  because there are a wide variety of schemas that have been studied that occur at different stages of in  dividuals  processing  and we are most interested in the schema that are relied upon as the very first step in one s processing  activating one s personality system   caps experts have yet to identify and categorize specific situation  encoding schemas  although  they do state that there is value in doing so and identify examples of psychological research that has attempted to do so     one of the primary contributions of this paper is to provide clarity and understanding around individuals  situation encoding schemas  fortunately  scholars have spent decades studying such schemas  while much of this research validates the important role they play in ex  plaining individuals  processing  behavioral dispositions  and behavior  research on specific situation encoding schemas has been rather iso  lated across various domains  spanning psychology  management  education  and marketing  in the next section  we integrate this re  search to   inform readers of the important and foundational role they play in leaders  processing and operation  and   create a framework to help leaders and those supporting them better identify and understand the situation encoding schemas they possess  why they process and operate in the manner they do  and how to improve their situation  encoding schemas to enhance their processing and operation   leaders  situation encoding schemas  it has been stated that the information that captures leaders  at  tention is what determines their direction and decision making  and ultimately their success and the success of the organizations they lead    since leaders  situation  encoding schemas are the bridge between the leader and their en  vironment  they play the initiatory role in determining what captures their attention and their subsequent processing and behaviors  this means that leaders  situation encoding schemas are foundational to how leaders process and operate  thus  it seems critical that we better un  derstand just how foundational these schemas are in how leaders pro  cess and operate  the implications for more fully adopting these schemas into leadership research and practice  and what specific si  tuation encoding schemas leaders can possess and develop   foundational role of situation encoding schemas  the foundational nature of situation encoding schemas becomes apparent when we go  under the hood  of leaders  processing and be  haviors and understand the neuropsychology behind these schemas  simply put  situation encoding schemas are neural networks in the prefrontal cortex that tap into leaders  associative processing mode    specifically  when individuals absorb information through their senses  this information is quickly sent to the individuals  executive processing system  their pre  frontal cortex  which functions to maximize benefits and minimize harm for the individual           miller      designed to create efficiencies  the prefrontal cortex possesses neural connections that stand ready to fire based upon spe  cific cues absorbed by our senses    the stronger the neural connections  the more readily and quickly they fire in response to such cues   the specific neural connections involved in our situation encoding schemas are connected to our associative   or slow processing  memory system    individuals  associative processing system uses knowledge accumulated from a large number of experi  ences to fill in information  quickly and automatically  about the cur  rent situation based upon similar situations we have previously ex  perienced    as such  this system is responsible for forming stable  general representations about the various properties we commonly encounter   in summary  situation encoding schemas are neural connections and networks that are primed to fire when specific cues are detected  quickly and efficiently interpreting the cues based upon past experience and knowledge  as neural connections strengthen  so does the auto  matic and habitual reliance on these specific networks  and the more likely an individual is to detect and retrieve cues according to the previous experiences which brought about and strengthened the neural networks in the first place  these strong neural networks influence and dispose individuals  focus  motivation  and self regulation for both the positive and the negative  while leaders  situation encoding schemas increase information processing speed    these situation encoding schemas also leave them vulnerable to biases and closed off to alternative perspectives  which can have significant ne  gative implications for their effectiveness as a leader   why situation encoding schemas have important leadership implications  although there has been relatively little focus on situation encoding schemas within the leadership domain to date  select situation en  coding schemas have received decades of research attention across multiple domains of study including management  psychology  educa  tion  and marketing  there are at least three aspects of this research that have important implications for the leadership domain  first  despite being studied independently  the research on situation encoding schemas has demonstrated consistent findings that suggest they largely dictate where individuals  place their attention  how they process in  formation  and how they behave  second  summarizing and integrating such research and bringing these attributes together under a common umbrella of situation encoding schemas can help guide leadership re  searchers in future scholarship  particularly scholarship related to the situation trait approach and the role these schemas play in the leader  ship process  finally  a focus on situation encoding schemas provides leaders and leadership developers with the novel perspective that if leaders can become more conscious of their situation encoding schemas  they can enhance their effectiveness in at least two ways  first  knowing about the role situation encoding schemas play in one s processing would allow leaders the opportunity to operate more con  sciously and manually override their automatic and often biased pro  cessing  second  since some situation encoding schemas have more positive effects on individuals  processing and operation than others  becoming conscious of one s current situation encoding schemas would allow leaders the ability to change and improve upon their non con  scious automatic processing   in this next section  we integrate and describe four well  and in  dependently studied situation encoding schemas into a single source and review the research on these schemas to demonstrate the founda  tional role they play in information processing  and subsequent op  eration  we also summarize the largely limited research that has been conducted on these schemas within the leadership domain  together  this information will allow us to describe and discuss the implications of situation encoding schemas on leadership theory and practice in our discussion section   review of four sets of situation encoding schemas  situation encoding schemas are distinctive processing profiles that cause individuals to interpret situational cues and activate individuals  processing dynamics in predictable ways across contexts that contain the same psychological features    al  though not always labeled as  situation encoding schemas   they have been studied for over   years across a variety of domains  alternative labels for these schemas include   encoding strategies      attractors      perceptual input function      orientations      mindsets  or  implicit theories     and  focus     collectively  researchers across domains have found that specific situation encoding schemas can be assessed in in  dividuals  and have been demonstrated to predictably dispose in  dividuals to specific ways of processing   and operation     while there is likely a wide variety of situation encoding schemas that could be identified and studied  there are four sets of such schemas that have received significant research attention  fixed and growth mindsets  goal orientations  deliberative and implemental mindsets  and regulatory focus  until now  these situation encoding schemas have been studied in relative isolation from each other  additionally  there has been little focus on these attributes within the leadership literature  although  in the instances when situation encoding schemas have been studied in relation to leadership  the findings have been significant and meaningful    we are the first to integrate them into a single source  and to collectively introduce them into the leadership domain   bringing these four sets of schemas into a single source enables us to develop a framework to help leaders investigate and assess their pro  cessing and behavioral dispositions  allowing for greater self awareness at the foundation of their processing  for leaders  this self awareness should empower them to become more conscious and regulatory in their processing and operation  further  it should facilitate more spe  cific predictions of a given leader s reaction to particular types of psy  chological situations     in this section  we introduce each of the four sets of situation en  coding schemas  in doing so  we have three objectives for each set  first  seek to describe the schemas  second  we summarize the existing re  search and evidence demonstrating how each set of schemas influences individuals  processing and behavioral dispositions  third  we sum  marize the limited amount research that does exist related specifically to the role they play in leaders  processing  behaviors  and effectiveness  after reviewing these sets of schemas  and in our discussion section  we summarize broader theoretical and practical implications for in  tegrating these four sets of situation encoding schemas more fully into the leadership domain   fixed and growth mindsets  fixed and growth mindsets  also called implicit theories  revolve around a person s lay beliefs about the malleability of their personal attributes    re  search on these mindsets were largely pioneered by psychologist  carol dweck  with most of her research being rooted in the educational psychology domain  as such  the majority of the research on fixed and growth mindsets over the last   years has occurred in that domain and its related domains  across this body of research  mindset researchers have found that individuals can either believe that people can change their personal attributes    or that they cannot change their personal attributes    and that such beliefs dramatically affect how individuals process and operate     r k  gottfredson and c s  reina the leadership quarterly             processing dispositions fixed and growth mindsets play a deep role within individuals   cognitive processes  one reason why is that these mindsets represent implicit beliefs  meaning that they may not explicitly articulated in the mind of the person holding them  yet  researchers have found that at the implicit  largely subconscious level  these beliefs actually   dictate the way people ascribe meaning to their environment and situations  and   prime a range of processing and behavioral dispositions  largely outside of one s awareness     interpreting situational cues  preserving and enhancing a sense of self  worth is a priority for all individuals    when individuals possess fixed or growth mindsets  their specific belief about the malleability of their personality attributes influences how they manage their sense of self worth    thus  their mindsets cause them to quickly scan for specific cues to inform them about how to best navigate their environment to preserve or enhance their self worth in a manner unique to their mindset   since individuals with a fixed mindset do not believe they can change or improve their attributes  their self worth is connected to the valuable attributes that they possess  they implicitly believe that if they experience failure  because they cannot develop or improve  such failure is an indication that they are a failure and of little worth    further  they also implicitly believe that if they experience success  such is an indication that they are of value  thus  wanting to protect their self worth and image  they are sensitive to cues that indicate whether the situations they encounter will threaten or confirm their self worth  situations that involve the opportunity for failure threaten their self worth  making them sensitive to cues that suggest uncertainty about their likelihood for success  such situations commonly involve what the individual considers to be a challenge or requiring effort    on the other hand  if a fixed mindset individual approaches a situation and ascertains that success is likely and or requires very little effort  they will see the situation as an opportunity to demonstrate their positive attributes and solidify themselves as someone of worth   since individuals with a growth mindset believe they can change or improve their attributes  their self worth is connected to their personal growth and development    thus  wanting to enhance their self worth  they are sensitive to cues that indicate whether the situations they encounter provide the opportunity for growth and development  the situations that provide the greatest opportunity for growth and development are the situations that those with a fixed mindset try to avoid  situations where there is uncertainty about success  usually challenges or situations that require effort     together  fixed and growth mindsets seek for similar cues associated with one s likelihood for success  specifically  they seek for cues related to the likelihood for failure   and anticipated effort re  quired for success  but they encode these cues very differently  those with a fixed mindset encode challenges and effort as situations to avoid  whereas those with a growth mindset encode such cues as situations to approach  these differences are summarized in the top half of table    activating processing dynamics  one of the primary ways fixed and growth mindsets influence individuals  processing is that they shape their self regulation  which is a core part of individuals  personality system  many prominent self regulation theories   rely upon the notion of a feedback loop to help explain individuals  motivations and behaviors  the basic premise of the feedback loop is that individuals set  goals  compare their progress against those goals  and make modifications to their behaviors or cognitions to resolve the discrepancy between their goals and their current state     interestingly  the psychological theories that use feedback loops to explain motivation and goal oriented behaviors largely consider the steps involved in the feedback loop to be a conscious process  while they surely can be a conscious process  these theories largely overlook the non conscious role situation encoding schemas play in shaping and dictating the entire feedback loop process  since situation encoding schemas occur quickly  non consciously  and automatically  they are an implicit force that shape the three main aspects of individuals  feedback loops  they   influence what goals the individual sets to begin with    influence the metrics individuals select and use to measure the gap between their goals and their current state  and   guide individuals to select specific behavioral and or cognitive options to resolve any such discrepancy that exists    acknowledging the underlying role situation encoding schemas play in this process has led researchers to suggest that much of our behavior is driven by non  conscious automatic processes     in the case of fixed mindsets  to preserve their sense of self worth  individuals implicitly develop goals to avoid failure and be viewed fa  vorably    consequently  they consistently measure and monitor how they are performing relative to expectations of  and in comparison to  others  correspondingly  they are non consciously directed to avoid failure and validate their ability    thus  fixed mindsets predispose individuals to self regulate by avoiding tasks or challenges where they are uncertain of success     in the case of growth mindsets  to enhance their self worth  in  dividuals implicitly develop goals to learn and develop in order to be viewed favorably    they monitor and measure their progress through the development of attributes  correspondingly  they are non consciously directed to take on tasks or challenges where they are uncertain about how successful they will be acknowledging that such tasks and challenges are essential for optimal learning and development    in fact  re  searchers have found that those with growth mindsets are more in  clined to seek out developmental opportunities and remain optimistic when struggling with their goal pursuits  when compared to fixed mindset individuals     additional evidence of the role these mindsets play in individuals  regulatory processes is found in how individuals with these different mindsets compare their performance to others and view feedback  researchers have found that fixed mindset individuals engage in downward comparisons to see if they outperformed others  while those with a growth mindset often engage in upward comparisons to learn from top performers    fur  ther  fixed mindset individuals tend to view constructive feedback as being self defeating  whereas growth mindset individuals view that same feedback as valuable information that enhances learning and development     other ways these mindsets influence individuals  processing dis  positions revolve around how fixed mindsets make individuals more prone to biases  consider the following findings  because individuals with a fixed mindset do not believe that others can change  compared to those with a growth mindset  they   are more likely to engage in fundamental attribution error  believing that others  behaviors are driven by their traits and are indicative of their underlying moral be  havior      are inclined to be more confident in their attributions of others and are less likely to change their attributions    and   are more likely to endorse  r k  gottfredson and c s  reina the leadership quarterly             punishment  hold stereotyped views  and resist information that coun  tered a stereotype     behavioral dispositions the options for individuals  behaviors are limited to the breadth and  depth of their processing  thus  it should not be a surprise to under  stand that individuals behave in a manner aligned with their proces  sing  we identify several specific ways fixed and growth mindsets dis  pose individuals to operate in distinct ways   first  these mindsets shape individuals  disposition toward avoiding versus approaching challenges  since the self worth of those with a fixed mindset is sensitive to failure  they are disposed to avoid chal  lenges or situations with potential for failure    on the other hand  implicitly believing that they are malleable and that growth enhances self worth  those with a growth mindset are disposed to approach challenges and situations at risk for failure as opportunities to learn and grow     second  researchers have found that individuals  mindsets cause them to develop different strategies for navigating achievement con  texts    perceiving achievement contexts as threats to their self worth  fixed mindset in  dividuals are inclined to adopt avoidant and self handicapping  strategies in an effort to self protect  those with a growth mindset view achievement contexts as opportunities for development and mastery  as such  they are more inclined to adopt problem solving strategies   third and relatedly  individuals  mindsets affect their willingness to exert effort and persist in the face of obstacles    since those with a fixed mindset do not believe that they can improve their talents  intelligence  and abilities  they believe that efforts to nurture one s abilities and improve performance are essentially futile  in fact  for those with a fixed mindset  the need to exert effort is inter  preted as an admission of a lack of ability    thus  if something does not come naturally to fixed  mindset individuals  they are more inclined to back away from a task rather than continually invest in the task  on the other hand  since those with a growth mindset believe that they can improve their talents  intelligence  and abilities  they see effort as the very instrument for improving their abilities    as such  when something does not come naturally to them  they are more inclined to persist  believing that success is the result of hard work  and that even geniuses have to work hard for their discoveries     additional findings related to how those with a fixed mindset op  erate differently from those with a growth mindset include the fol  lowing    lower motivation      progress to  ward goals less quickly      poorer negotiation performance      are more  table   how fixed and growth mindsets influence individual processing and operation   fixed mindset growth mindset citations  processing

fixed and growth mindsets exists  outside of a leadership context  the little evidence that is there de  monstrates that leaders aren t immune to the effects their fixed or growth mindsets have on their processing and behavioral dispositions  and select studies have demonstrated that is the case  specific studies reveal that those with growth mindsets are more likely to engage in efforts to develop their followers    demonstrate greater leadership confidence    and set more challenging goals     considering the breadth of research on fixed and growth mindsets  we should anticipate fixed

ef  fort  adopt problem solving strategies  and invest in the development of others  in all  research has rather conclusively demonstrated that we should expect leaders  processing  behaviors  and overall effectiveness to be more positive if they possess a growth mindset compared to a fixed mindset   goal orientation  goal orientation has become one of the most frequently studied motivational variables in applied psychology and is a dominant ap  proach in the study of achievement motivation    the basic premise of goal orientations is that individuals  largely non consciously  take on a specific goal preference or orientation toward their achievement si  tuations  and the goal orientation they adopt directs their efforts to support the goal they are oriented toward   individuals  goal orientations are generally described as a disposi  tion that is a  somewhat stable individual difference factor that may be influenced by situational characteristics     additionally  scholars have suggested that individuals  goal orientations represent neural wiring in individuals  brains  that when frequently activated become increasingly accessible and even  tually become chronic in the sense that they are chronically ready to be activated and acted upon     while many conceptualizations of goal orientations exist  most conceptualizations have primarily revolved around two primary or  ientations  a learning orientation and performance orientation    a learning orientation involves being moti  vated toward increasing one s competence and mastering something new  a performance orientation involves being motivated toward gaining favorable judgements about competence or avoiding negative judgments about one s competence   originally  goal orientation researchers believed goal orientation to be a bipolar construct  suggesting that individuals could be high   on one orientation  but not simultaneously high   on both    but  since then  research has established that not only are these two orientations separate constructs  but that each orientation can be further broken down into two separate  dimensions approach and avoid identifying up to four types of goal orientation  learning approach    learning avoid    performance approach    and performance avoid    however  researchers have historically fo  cused primarily on a three factor model involving learning approach  performance approach  and performance avoid orientations     although different from other situation encoding schemas  goal orientations do share some similarities with fixed and growth mindsets  notably  both of these situation encoding schemas were developed in the educational psychology domain  in fact  carol dweck s foray into fixed and growth mindsets began with conducting research on goal orientations and similar constructs  and she eventually suggested that fixed and growth mindsets may be antecedents to goal orientations  with fixed mindset being more strongly related to performance or  ientation  and growth mindset being more strongly related to learning orientation    while this re  lationship between fixed growth mindsets and goal orientation has been largely accepted  it has been largely untested  and meta analytic correlations between the two situation encoding schemas have been quite small  suggesting that there may not be a causal relationship between the two situation encoding schemas and that the two situation  encoding schemas may be more distinct than thought previously    in fact  for the most part  research on these two types of situation encoding schemas have been rather isolated from each other  and notably  goal orientations have received significantly more attention within the management domain  enough for vandewalle et al    to review goal orientation research spe  cifically from this domain   like the other situation encoding schemas  goal orientations have been found to activate and influence individuals  processing and be  havioral dispositions  which ultimately have important implications for leadership  we discuss below and summarize in table     processing dispositions research across the three most commonly studied goal orientations  has been consistent  learning goal orientation generally has positive relationships with self regulatory processes  performance avoid goal orientation has overwhelmingly negative relationships with self reg  ulatory processes  and performance approach goal orientation largely has non significant relationships with self regulatory processes    we discuss why this is and specific findings below   interpreting situational cues  although goal orientations are related to the motivations for achievement within achievement contexts  the foundation of this motivation is rooted in individuals  appearance of their competence    effectively  this means that individuals develop different definitions for success    success for those with a learning orientation is enhancing self perceptions of their competence  success for those with a performance approach orientation is being seen as being competent by others  often in comparison to others  success for those with a performance avoid orientation is avoiding being seen as incompetent   as such  individuals  goal orientations cause them to be sensitive to situational cues that indicate their likelihood of success in the manner that they define it  since those with a learning orientation are primarily concerned about their self perceptions of their competence  they seek cues to indicate that their situation is one where they can make in  cremental improvements to one s self    those with either  r k  gottfredson and c s  reina the leadership quarterly             of the performance orientations are primarily concerned about others perceptions of their competence    more specifically  those with a performance approach goal orientation want to demonstrate to others that they possess high competence  thus  they are sensitive to cues that signal the ease at which one can perform or succeed relative to others  if cues suggest that they will not perform as well as others  their processing and behavioral dispositions are in  clined to avoiding the situation    those with a performance avoid goal orientation want to avoid de  monstrating incompetence to others  thus  they are sensitive to cues that signal the likelihood of failure and or the ease at which one can perform above a minimum standard of achievement     activating processing dynamics  since individuals  goal orientations cause them to define success differently  their personality system is primed to function in a manner that supports their definition of success    there are three primary ways goal orientations have been found to shape individuals  processing   first  individuals  goal orientations non consciously underlie and influence individuals  self regulation  in a similar fashion as fixed and growth mindsets  goal orientations shape the goals individual adopt  how they measure their success relative to their goals  and the actions they take to address any gaps between their level of success relative to their goals    essentially  goal orientations explain what goals individuals set  why some people set higher goals than others  why some people persist longer in the face of adversity  and why some people tend to avoid achievement situations    in all  goal orientations activate the processing involved in determining the allocation of effort in achievement related situations   second  individuals  goal orientations have been found to explain the learning strategies individuals adopt    specifically  goal orientation researchers have examined two different types of learning strategies  surface level strategies   and deep level strategies    across multiple contexts  individuals with a learning goal orientation tend to use more deep level strategies  whereas those with performance  goal orientations tend to use more surface level strategies    correspondingly  researchers have found that there is a positive relationship between learning orientation and transfer of training for those with a learning orientation  a non  significant relationship for those with a performance approach or  ientation  and a negative relationship for those with a performance  avoid orientation     third  individuals  goal orientation explains the likelihood an in  dividual will seek feedback    researchers have found is that there are both benefits and costs to seeking feedback  the benefits largely involve gaining information to improve learning and performance  the costs largely involve poten  tially exposing one s lack of competence  those with a learning or  ientation weigh the benefits much more highly than the costs  and as such  are much more inclined to seek feedback  those with a perfor  mance orientation tend to weigh the costs more highly than the bene  fits  making them more reluctant to seek feedback   some additional ways research has indicated that individuals  goal orientations affect individuals processing include affecting their state goal orientations  state anxiety  and specific self efficacy    for example  there is evidence to suggest that those with per  formance orientations are more anxious than those with a learning orientation  and such anxiety can affect individuals  behavior and per  formance     behavioral dispositions arguably  the most widely studied behavioral disposition studied in  relation to goal orientation is effort  from a theoretical standpoint  individuals are more likely to exert effort if the situation appears to be aligned and supportive of their definition for success  but  empirically  what researchers have found across a wide variety of contexts is that those with a learning orientation are more disposed to engage in higher levels of effort and persist longer compared to those with a performance orientation    one of the primary explanations for this consistent finding is that those with learning orientations are more intrinsically motivated than those with performance orientations     researchers have also found that individuals operate in predictably  table   how goal orientations influence individual processing and operation   performance avoid goal orientation

quarterly             different ways  first  since those with performance goal orientations are concerned about their competence relative to referent others  they are more likely to compete and refrain from information sharing in an ef  fort to gain a competitive advantage  whereas those with a learning goal orientation are more likely to cooperate  seeing information sharing as an opportunity for supporting mutual growth    second  those with a performance goal orientation are more likely to engage in problematic and counterproductive behaviors  such as cheating  in order to promote their competence  for example  van yperen et al    found that those assigned to a performance goal condition cheated at nearly twice the rate as those with a learning goal condition  finally  research has repeatedly found that those with a learning orientation are more willing to change and do a better job of successfully adapting to change than those with performance goal or  ientations     recognizing that individuals  goal orientations shape their effort and operation  it is no surprise that researchers have found significant relationships between goal orientation and performance  notably  when van yperen et al    meta analytically investigated the relationship between goal orientation and non self reported performance moderated by setting    they found that the relation  ships were more extreme for work settings compared to education and sports settings  specifically  they found that the relationships between learning goal orientation and performance in a work setting was much higher than the other settings    and higher than in  dicated in prior meta analyses that did not engage in moderator ana  lyses    the relationship between performance approach and performance was r        with no differ  ence across settings  and the relationship between performance avoid and performance was r   −    in a work setting and r   −    and r   −    for education and sports settings  respectively   as a whole  all of the research on goal orientation led cellar et al    to state   thus based on the existing research  we conclude that the  learning  approach trait goal orientation may well be the most desirable orientation in achievement contexts  this is likely the case because the  learning  approach orientation results in more frequent and persistent self regulation activities      existing research related to leadership domain while most goal orientation research has not been directed at lea   ders  there is little reason to think that the conclusive results would differ for a leader population  based upon the findings described above  we anticipate leaders with a learning goal orientation will be sensitive to situations that may enhance their ability to develop  develop goals focused on learning  utilize deep level learning strategies  seek feed  back  be willing to exert effort  cooperate  and perform at a high level  those with either of the performance goal orientations will be sensitive to situations where they can demonstrate their competence  develop goals focused on performing at a certain level  utilize surface level learning strategies  avoid feedback  be relatively unwilling to exert ef  fort  compete  and perform at a lower level   in the research that has been conducted on goal orientation related to leadership  these assumptions have largely been validated  findings suggest that goal orientation is likely important for   leadership emergence and development      the quality of relationships leaders have with their followers      leaders  willingness to embrace change    and   the behaviors and styles a leader adopts    in all  evidence suggests that a leader s goal orientation non consciously influences the effectiveness of their processing and behaviors  and that possessing a learning goal orientation is most optimal to leader effectiveness and success   deliberative and implemental mindsets  the third set of situation encoding schemas that we review are deliberative and implemental mindsets  like the other situation en  coding schemas  this set is concerned with individuals  non conscious processing that drives one s goal related motivations and striving  but it is rooted in different psychological theories  mainly those associated with decision making    being from a different theo  retical foundation  research on these mindsets has been largely isolated from the other situation encoding schemas even though the effects found have also been shown to dictate individuals  processing and be  havioral dispositions   the initial impetus for studying these mindsets was based on the idea that as individuals go through the decision making process  they generally take on different mindsets    origin  ally  it was suggested that early in the decision making process  in  dividuals have a heightened receptiveness to all kinds of information    but  in the later stages of the decision  making process  individuals become more selective in their processing  allowing them to focus on implementing decisions  and thus closing them off to new ideas and information     with this view  early researchers theorized that when individuals possess a deliberative mindset  the deliberation they engage in would deplete their cognitive resources  causing them to perform more poorly on subsequent short term memory tasks than those more focused on implementing decisions    who likely use less cognitive resources  however  they found the exact opposite     researchers found that when individuals possess a deliberative mindset  it activates the brain s ability to explore things outside what one has been deliberating  causing a heightened receptiveness to all kinds of information    and  on the other hand  pos  sessing an implemental mindset activates the brain s ability to focus on a single task and deactivates the brains ability to be receptive to new non relevant information     while initial theorization suggested that these mindsets occur in different stages of the decision making process  subsequent research and theory suggest that they do not necessarily fluctuate as one pro  ceeds through different decision making stages  instead  it is more of a condition of the mind that affects overall processing    in fact  most research on these mindsets involve experiments where these mindsets are manipulated or primed  suggesting that regardless of where one is in the decision making process  he she can possess either a deliberative or implemental mindset   processing dispositions like the other situation encoding schemas  deliberative and imple   mental mindsets dictate the cues and information individuals absorb  and in turn  activates different  yet predictable processing dynamics  we summarize their unique processing dispositions in the top half of table     interpreting situational cues  similar to fixed and growth mindsets and goal orientations  deliberative and implemental mindsets are connected to individuals  perceptions of their worth  in the case of deliberative and implemental mindsets  individuals are concerned about their rightness  those with a deliberative mindset want to make the most appropriate decisions  as a result  they believe that their value is connected to their ability to get closer to truth and think optimally  those with an implemental mindset think that they are right  as a result  their value is connected to being seen as being right  both mindsets are cognitively attuned to information that confirms or supports their perspective     at the encoding level  those with a deliberative mindset are sensi  tive to cues that indicate an opportunity for improving in one s pro  cessing and decision making           taylor   gollwitzer      they are more primed to explore why one should do something and information related to the pros and cons of different possibilities  on the other hand  those with an implemental mindset are sensitive to cues that indicate their perspective is correct and that they can proceed accordingly    they are more primed to explore how  when  and where one should do something  consequently  these schemas shape individuals  processing as follows   activating processing dynamics  research has found that these mindsets affect individuals  processing in two primary ways  the degree to which one engages in biased thinking and one s openness to information   relative to those with an implemental mindset  those with a de  velopmental mindset are more impartial  less biased  and more accurate in their processing and decision making    research has demonstrated this in three primary ways  first  researchers have found that after making a selection between options  those with im  plemental mindsets view the non selected alternatives more negatively than those with a deliberative mindset    leaving those with a deliberative mindset more open to the value of alternative ideas  second  researchers have found that those possessing a deliberative mindset are more accurate judges of their control or impact over the situations they encounter than those possessing an implemental mindset    when individuals were successful at a task that they did not have control over    those with a deliberative mindset were more open to the idea that their success was not fully attributed to them  selves  whereas those with an implemental mindset tended to believe that their success was more fully the result of their performance    this has led researchers to assert that those with implemental mindsets are more prone to illusions of invulnerability  and less accurately perceive their abilities and probabilities for success    finally  researchers have found that those with an implemental mindset are more likely to develop an extreme position  particularly around a course of action they are implementing  but interestingly  these effects are not just associated with the issue at hand and have found to carry over to issues irrelevant to one s goal concern     as mentioned previously  researchers originally conceptualized these mindsets as being part of a decision making process  these find  ings demonstrate that these mindsets are not solely associated with the  decision making process  but also persist beyond current tasks  further  an acknowledged premise of effective decision making is  that in order to make the best possible decisions  one should   be open to any available information that might inform one s decisions    avoid prematurely dismissing relevant information  and   be willing to change one s mind in light of new ideas    across the body of deliberative and implemental mindset research  researchers con  sistently find that those with deliberative mindsets are much more open to new information and thus more open minded as a whole  leading them to be more effective decision makers relative to those with im  plemental mindsets  additionally  those with deliberative mindsets are more inclined to spot relevant information and engage in less selective filtering than those with implemental mindsets     behavioral dispositions until now  we have largely presented implemental mindsets in a  negative light  but  research indicates that this mindset is not always negative    there seems to be some benefits to having implemental mindsets  although  as we will discuss  perhaps these benefits need to be slightly tempered  research indicates that those with implemental mindsets are more focused on implementing a decision  and as such  they are able to exert greater focus and effort toward a specific course of action than those with de  liberative mindsets    specifically  relative to those with deliberative mindsets  those with implemental mindsets   are faster to initiate goal directed behavior      generate greater persistence in goal directed behavior  particularly when feasi  bility was deemed low and desirability deemed high  or vice versa    and   demonstrate greater effort and performance on certain tasks    partly because of their more optimistic outcome expectations and overestimating the ease of the task     while these findings surely seem positive for possessing an instru  mental mindset  there are a couple of factors to further consider  first  while instrumental mindsets seem valuable when one needs to imple  ment a decision  they do not seem valuable when having to make a decision  thus  a tradeoff potentially exists  making the best decision and possibly implementing that decision at a slower or more thoughtful pace or possibly implementing a less than optimal decision at a quicker pace  second  it seems likely that the complexity of the decision and task needs to be taken into consideration  there are some decisions and  table   how deliberative and implemental mindsets influence individual processing and operation   deliberative mindset

s  reina the leadership quarterly             tasks that  perhaps because of their obviousness or simplicity  do not require a deliberative mindset  making an implemental mindset more beneficial  but  it is important to recognize that  while the weightiest and most important decisions may be infrequent  often they are quite complex  and likely require a deliberative mindset  further  it is im  portant to recognize that there are some individuals in certain organi  zational positions that consistently deal with more complex and weighty decisions   who would presumably function more effectively with a deliberative mindset   existing research related to leadership domain unfortunately  there has yet to be much research directly in   vestigating the role that deliberative and implemental mindsets play in leadership effectiveness  but the implications of deliberative and im  plemental mindset research surely seem relevant  gollwitzer   asserts that deliberative and implemental mindsets have  enormous influence  on how individuals process information    thus  we suggest that if leaders  processing and decision making shapes the di  rection and success of their organizations  whether they possess delib  erative or implemental mindsets can have  enormous  implications  while implemental mindsets do seem to have some positives in terms of effectiveness in implementing decisions  such mindsets may also leave one prone to biases and closed to potentially relevant information  which can reduce the effectiveness of one s decisions in the first place  leaders with a deliberative mindset appear much more inclined to be sensitive and open to new and novel information  and less biased in their processing  this is surely important for effective decision making  but it is likely also important for the engagement of employees  as deliberative mindsets are likely necessary for creating a psychologically safe and engaging workplace   regulatory focus  regulatory focus theory is a well studied theory in the organiza  tional domain that suggests that individuals regulate their cognition and behavior during goal pursuit  generally to either maximize pleasure or to minimize pain    as such  regulatory focus theory de  scribes how individuals regulate through two coexisting regulatory systems that cater to different needs and interests during goal pursuit    these systems are called prevention and promotion focus and represent two different goal striving strategies    simply stated  those with a prevention focus are focused on winning  gaining  and accomplishing  while those with a promotion focus are focused on avoiding losses     there have been over   studies conducted on regulatory focus    what researchers have found is that individuals  regulatory foci are situation encoding schemas that shapes how in  dividuals view their world and approach their goals  and as such  is a foundational driver of the affect  cognitions    and behaviors individuals engage in to accomplish their goals    while these two forms of regulatory focus are theoretically independent    individuals generally possess a dominant focus as a trait like quality     despite some similarity between regulatory focus and the other perceptual attributes  especially goal orientation  they are considered distinct    kark   van dijk   explain that the primary difference between these situation encoding schemas is that while both are focused on approaching or avoiding positive or negative end states  goal orientation schemas do not distinguish be  tween different types of positive or negative end states  by this  they mean that theory related to goal orientation suggests that individuals typically approach positive end states and avoid negative end states   regulatory focus schemas  on the other hand  are concerned with dis  tinct types of end states  and suggest that individuals can approach positive or negative end states through either approach or avoid ac  tions   in lanaj et al  s   meta analysis  the authors summarize the research associated with regulatory focus as follows   based upon the evidence to date  promotion and prevention foci appear to be important person based variables that influence self regulation and behavior at work     much of the research that led them to make this con  clusion has been focused on how these regulatory foci dictate in  dividuals  processing associated with their evaluation of their work  place perceptions and attitudes  this research is largely summarized in table     processing dispositions like the other situation encoding schemas  the regulatory focus  schemas influence both the cues individuals absorb and the activation of their personality system as described below   interpreting situational cues  kark and van dijk   stated that  regulatory focus theory can be thought of as one of the most comprehensive motivation theories  since its constructs seem to comprise a primary element of human motivation     this primary element involves the non conscious regulation individuals engage in to maximize pleasure or to minimize pain  in fact  researchers have isolated this regulation within the prefrontal cortex  specifically  shah  higgins  and friedman   found that promotion focus is associated with greater left prefrontal activity  and thus positive thinking and maximizing pleasure  while prevention focus is associated with greater right prefrontal activity  which drives negative thinking and minimizing pain   specifically  individuals with a prevention focus are sensitive to cues that indicate the likelihood of negative affect  safety  and security    they are especially sensitive to cues related to risk  such cues guide prevention focused individuals on how to best fulfill their duties and obligations  maintain an acceptable standard of performance  and limit mistakes and errors    those with a promotion focus  on the other hand  are sensitive to cues that indicate the likelihood of positive affect  growth  and accom  plishment    such cues guide promotion focused individuals on how to best fulfill their goals and aspirations  advance and make progress  and attain their ideal self    rather than interpret risk as something to avoid  they interpret it as being a necessary part of the process of progress and advancement   activating processing dynamics  since the motivations associated with each regulatory focus schema differ  it is natural that their processing differs  which includes their focus  goals  desires  and behaviors    those with a prevention focus are motivated to avoid problems and losses  which leads their personality system to be programmed for vigilance  avoidance  stability  exploitation  and maintaining the status quo    those with a promotion focus are motivated to seek winning and gains  which leads their personality system to be programmed for eagerness  speed  achievement  exploration  and change     as most of the research on regulatory focus has occurred within the management domain  researchers have commonly investigated the ef  fects regulatory focus schemas have on how employees process and perceive their work environment  in the form of workplace perceptions and attitudes that include job satisfaction  commitment  and engage  ment   job satisfaction  affective commitment  and engagement are each considered to be positive and desired employee perceptions and  r k  gottfredson and c s  reina the leadership quarterly             attitudes  the research between the regulatory foci and these outcomes portrays consistent findings  promotion focus has a strong positive re  lationship with these outcomes    while prevention focus has either a small positive or negative re  lationship with these outcomes    the primary explanations for these re  lationships are that  compared to those with a prevention focus  those with a promotion focus are more perceptive to positive information  more intrinsically motivated  and more emotionally connected to their work because they see work as a way to fulfill their ideal selves  al  lowing them to go beyond their minimum job requirements   continuance and normative commitment have also been studied as consequences of regulatory foci  these forms of commitment both in  volve an element of feeling compelled to remain a member of the or  ganization  and as such  have been theorized to have a stronger re  lationship with prevention focus  for continuance commitment  meta  analyses have confirmed that prevention focus has a moderate positive relationship with continuance commitment    while promotion focus  on the other hand  has a small positive relationship with continuance commitment    for normative commitment  meta analytic results suggest that promotion focus has a stronger positive relationship with normative commitment   than prevention focus     behavioral dispositions similar to perceptions and attitudes  research associated with the  relationships between the regulatory focus schemas and behaviors and performance are rather consistent  for the most part  those with a promotion focus seem to outperform those with a prevention focus  this is largely because those with a promotion focus are more satisfied  committed  engaged  and motivated to enhance their self concept  specifically  it has been found that compared to those with a prevention focus  those with a promotion focus set more challenging goals and  exhibit greater persistence  task performance  organizational behavior  and innovative performance    in fact  for each of these types of performance  relationships with promotion focus are moderately positive    while relationships with prevention focus are largely nonexistent    in addition  meta analyses reveal that promotion focus has a moderate negative relationship with counterproductive work behaviors    while prevention focus has a moderate positive relationship with cwbs     overwhelmingly  research has consistently found that those with a promotion mindset outperform those with a prevention mindset  however  there is one area where this is not the case  based upon meta  analytic results  it appears there is one primary behavioral benefit to possessing a prevention focus  which is that it has a strong positive relationship with safety performance    while promotion focus has a small moderate negative relationship with safety performance    this is largely because those with a prevention mindset are mentally cued to safety and security  and are more vigilant to safety related issues   existing research related to leadership domain leader s regulatory focus has been found to have important im   plications for how the leader operates  their influence on those they lead  and even the success of an organization  in terms of the influence of regulatory focus schemas on how leaders operate  researchers have found that those with a promotion focus are viewed more as transfor  mational leaders  possessing greater motivation for accomplishments and aspirations  whereas those with a prevention focus are viewed more as transactional leaders  seeking to maintain order and stability in the workplace     related to the influence of leaders  regulatory focus schemas on those they lead

schemas  upon identifying  describing  and summarizing the research asso  ciated with the four sets of situation encoding schemas  we feel it is important to bring attention to four broad observations  first  there has been decades of research studies supporting the foundational role that these four situation encoding schemas play in how people and leaders process and behave  second  the amount of research on these schemas related to leadership is relatively small  and additional research is not only needed  but  we believe  will prove quite fruitful  third  alto  gether  the existing research strongly supports the idea that certain si  tuation encoding schemas are more conducive to leadership effective  ness   than other schemas    which has important development implications  fourth  while we seem to know some schemas are more conducive for success than others  we currently have little research or understanding regarding how the dif  ferent schemas are related  while some research has pointed toward some natural consistencies between schemas    their relationships with each other needs to be further explored  we further elaborate this point later in our discussion section  altogether  we believe substantial evi  dence exists for more fully integrating situation encoding schemas into our research and conversations related to the important ingredients of effective leadership   before moving on  it is important to acknowledge that while in  dividuals  situation encoding schemas generally dictate their processing and behavioral dispositions  it seems likely that certain situations may be strong enough for these individuals to overcome their natural schematic tendencies  for example  individuals may normally possess a performance orientation  but if they are required to learn or master some material    the situation may elicit a learning orientation  in fact  as we will discuss below  research across these schemas has demonstrated that relatively simple interventions designed to elicit more positive situation encoding schemas generally will lead to at least a short term positive shift in one s processing and behaviors     discussion  our paper had three purposes    to shift consensus within the leadership literature away from the more traditional trait approach toward the more modern situation trait approach to better understand why leaders do what they do    identify situation encoding schemas as being critical and foundational components that explain why leaders process and operate uniquely across the situations they encounter  and   integrate and review research on four types of situation encoding schemas to more fully introduce these schemas into the leadership domain  we summarize these contributions in preparation for dis  cussing the important implications they have for leadership research and practice   in the first section  entitled  the study of why leaders do what they do   we identify that leaders  traits have been a traditional focus for explaining how leaders operate  this approach has a number of limitations which may limit our ability to gain a complete under  standing for why leaders process and behave the ways that they do  for example  the trait approach assumes that leaders  variations in behavior across situations are assumed to be  errors   as opposed to valuable information into how they process and behave  acknowledging these limitations  we integrate the caps framework from psychology to ad  vance and build the case for a robust approach to understanding leader effectiveness which utilizes the situation trait approach  it carries its own assumptions suggesting that when explaining leaders  processing and behaviors  it is necessary to consider both the situation and how it interacts with leaders  traits   we cover the caps framework in our second section   modeling the situation trait approach   the caps framework suggests that why in  dividuals operate in the manner they do begins with how they encode unique cues in the situations they encounter  this encoding activates individuals  personality system  which in turn  causes the individual to behave and navigate the situation in a manner aligned with the per  sonality system s processing  as such  the encoding process is founda  tional to and directs the leaders  personality system  the personal at  tributes that guide individuals  encoding process are situation encoding schemas  making these attributes a crucial and foundational component of individuals  processing and behavior   in the third section  entitled  leaders  situation encoding schemas   we demonstrate just how foundational these attributes are in leaders  processing by  going under the hood  and summarizing the neu  ropsychology behind these schemas  specifically  we identify situation  encoding schemas as neural networks in the prefrontal cortex that tap into leaders  associative processing mode  as such  they automatically and largely non consciously direct leaders  cue seeking and processing activation  being foundational to how leaders view their environments and subsequently how they process and behave relative to their per  ception of their environments  we suggest that better understanding leaders  situation encoding schemas and integrating them more fully into the leadership literature will have important and meaningful im  plications for leadership research and practice  thus  it is important to identify specific situation encoding schemas that underlie leaders  processing and behaviors   in the fourth section  entitled  review of four sets of situation  encoding schemas   we identify and integrate research on four sets of situation encoding schemas that have been independently studied for decades across various research domains  fixed and growth mindsets  goal orientations  deliberative and implemental mindsets  and reg  ulatory focus  despite being studied independently  research across these schemas has repeatedly found that they do dictate individuals  processing dispositions   and behavioral dispositions  as such  they are likely to have important implications for leadership  and we summarize the research to date and integrating these previously independently studied schemas into one source   r k  gottfredson and c s  reina the leadership quarterly             implications for leadership  by understanding the situation trait approach  the caps framework  the encoding process  and situation encoding schemas that direct the encoding process  we are able to come to a more clear and accurate understanding of the complexity of leaders  operations  further  it al  lows us to more clearly identify situation encoding schemas to be a foundational component behind leaders  processing and operation  this has a variety of important implications that include  enhancing leaders  self awareness  improving leaders  meta cognition  improving leader  ship effectiveness  and improving leadership development   enhancing leaders  self awareness remarkably  until this point  leadership researchers have largely  treated the variation of leader behaviors as error and eliminated it by simply averaging behavior over diverse situations    but  with the situation trait approach and caps theory  it be  comes possible to identify meaningful stable situation behavior   profiles activated by situation encoding schemas that predictably explain variations in behavior across situations    since the leadership domain has largely not considered the situation trait approach or foundational role situation encoding schemas play in leaders  processing and operation  leaders have largely lacked a framework to help them understand why they do what they do across the various situations they encounter  and we suggest that the current framework provides the opportunity for greater clarity and self  awareness   in particular  we have identified four sets of situation encoding schemas that dispose leaders to specific processing and behaviors  each of these sets identifies at least two possible schemas  but research suggests that leaders tend to rely on a single dominant schema for their encoding system  if leaders can identify the schema that they possess  they can better understand why they are disposed to process and be  have in the manners that they do across different situations  further  across the research on these different sets of situation encoding schemas  research has made it quite clear that certain schemas lead to better processing and behavior than other schemas  this allows leaders to determine if they are disposed to process and behave in the most effective ways   if we put all four sets of schemas together into a single framework  it allows leaders to develop a multifaceted profile of their processing system  are they fixed  or growth minded  learning  or performance  oriented  deliberative  or implemental minded  and promotion  or prevention focused  knowing their profile  leaders and those who support them can develop inferences related to the leaders  underlying structure and dynamics and better understand why leaders process and behave in the specific manner they do    this has three important implications for the leadership domain that we discuss next   improving leaders  meta cognition meta cognition is defined as deliberate  planned  intentional  goal   directed  and future oriented mental processing that can be used to accomplish cognitive tasks    when leaders understand how they are disposed to process and operate  it provides them with the opportunity to become more conscious about how they process and operate   specifically  there are at least three benefits of leaders under  standing their situation encoding profile    first  they can better predict the events and conditions that will activate certain dispositions  helping them to be more strategic about their de  cision making  second  they can become more conscious of the situa  tions they put themselves in  helping them avoid situations that bring out negative processing and behavioral dispositions and approach si  tuations that bring out their positive processing and behavioral dis  positions  third  knowing what cues they are naturally attuned to  they  can consciously seek after other cues that they do not normally pay much attention to  expanding the range of their processing and options for behavior  in all  with a greater ability to meta cognate about their situation encoding schemas  leaders will be more empowered to meet their role demands in their most effective ways     improving leaders  effectiveness as leaders improve in their self awareness  they enhance their be   havioral freedom and their ability to operate more consciously  instead of falling back into non conscious and predictable patterns of proces  sing and behaviors    thus  as leaders get to know their situation encoding schemas  various options for improving their effectiveness become available    first  by understanding what schemas they currently possess and what schemas are most ideal for leader effectiveness  leaders can seek to more fully adopt the schemas most ideal for leader effectiveness  as leaders make improvements to their schemas  naturally their processing and behavior will improve  making them more effective  second  by understanding the cues one naturally seeks  and what other cues might be helpful for improved processing and behaviors  leaders can con  sciously seek after different cues to disrupt their typical personality system patterns  third  by understanding the situations that activate less effective and more effective processing and behavior  leaders can consciously select the situations to which they expose themselves to bring out their best   improving leaders  development one of the great things about focusing on situation encoding  schemas in light of leadership development and effectiveness is that there is ample evidence that individuals can change and improve their schemas  and when they do  there is a corresponding improvement in their processing and behaviors    and often  research has repeatedly found that leaders  situation encoding schemas can be improved through relatively simple interventions  such as  reading fictional studies    writing two para  graphs    watching a three minute video    imagining responses to situations   or engaging in a training    for example  kilduff and galinsky   found that individuals asked to write two paragraphs about their aspirations and ambitions   were more proactive in their behaviors and achieved higher social status than those asked to write two paragraphs about their duties and obligations     the basic idea is that when an individual is primed to encode their situations differently  they are activating and strengthening neural con  nections in their prefrontal cortex that may not fire as rapidly as their dominant situation encoding neural connections  knowing that neural connections strengthen and operate more rapidly the more they get used  it suggests that shifting a leaders  situation encoding schemas requires regular primes or interventions  which over time strengthens their less  dominant but more positive schemas  making them more dominant and having lasting positive implications for their subsequent processing and behavioral dispositions     understanding these dynamics uncovers three things that leaders or those who develop leaders can do to help leaders shift from less than  optimal situation encoding schemas   to more optimal situation encoding schemas   to develop more effective processing and behaviors  and overall effectiveness  first  help leaders understand the role their situation encoding schemas play in their processing and behavior  without this understanding  it will be difficult to have the motivation to focus on situation encoding schemas as a way to develop  second  help leaders identify and distinguish between less   r k  gottfredson and c s  reina the leadership quarterly             than optimal situation encoding schemas and more optimal situation  encoding schemas  this will help leaders become more conscious of their situation encoding schemas and the quality of their current si  tuation encoding schema profiles and it will help them identify areas for development and improvement  third  develop interventions and initiatives to help leaders adopt the more optimal situation encoding schemas  these interventions and initiatives should be designed to ex  ercise and strengthen the neural connections associated with the more optimal situation encoding schemas  as those neural connections are strengthened  leaders will come to rely upon them more frequently  improving their processing and behavioral dispositions   we must point out that this approach to leadership development has not been available under the trait and behavior approaches that lea  dership scholars have traditionally leaned upon  when scholars have focused on leaders  traits and behaviors  the practical developmental implications all relate to improving select traits and behaviors  but  what the situation trait approach reveals is that even if a leader can make shifts in traits and behaviors  if they continue to encode their situations in the same ways  development in traits and behaviors may be limited and may not translate into any greater leader effectiveness  this is what caps experts were referring to when they stated that the traditional trait approach may help when determining which car to buy    but that it provides little value for fixing the car if it is not running properly    the situation trait approach allows us to get  under the hood  of leaders  psychological processes and dynamics and to work on any of the pro  cessing that may not be functioning properly   finally  while we have focused primarily on the encoding process  it is important to step back and more broadly consider the implications that improving one s situation encoding schemas might have on the caps framework  while it is easy to suggest that leadership effective  ness will naturally improve when leaders improve their situation en  coding schemas  the reality is likely more complex  when leaders im  prove their schemas  these new schemas may activate different elements of the leaders  personality systems    as a consequence  it is possible that the leaders  entire personality system will be restructured  for both the positive or the negative  for example  the new schemas may trigger more positive self efficacy beliefs  opening up new expectancies and goals  but  they may also trigger anxiety associated with perceiving situations in new  unproven  and uncertain ways  stifling the positive impact of the new schemas  thus  while we are promoting the value of an increased focus on the encoding system and situation encoding schemas  at least two important leadership implications exist beyond this system and schemas  first  while improving situation encoding schemas may be an important answer for developing leaders  it is not the entire answer  effective leadership development will require both developing new  if then   signatures and subsequent restructuring within the personality system  second  understanding the broader caps framework will help leaders develop greater self awareness and meta  cognitive skills beyond their encoding processing  more specifically  understanding the entirety of the caps framework will also help lea  ders to become more self aware of their personality system and develop improved metacognitive skills to ensure that the changes in their schemas result in improved processing and behavioral dispositions   further theoretical implications one of the major purposes of this paper is to help the leadership  literature shift consensus more completely away from the trait ap  proach and toward the situation trait approach  there are a variety of theoretical implications related to this shift  first  it aligns the leader  ship literature with the most current thought and theories from the psychological domain  second  it provides a more accurate foundation and perspective for explaining why leaders do what they do  third  this approach introduces new questions and new constructs   to focus on for the development and effectiveness of  leaders  which both broadens and deepens the pool of important in  gredients of effective leadership  and should lead to further theoretical insights and development   future research  one of the values of the caps framework is that it is a meta theory  providing a context by which new theories that explain various ele  ments of leaders  processing and behavioral manifestations can be de  veloped  while caps provides a general understanding of the processes that underly leadership behavior  there is still much research needed to fully explain these processes  in other words  future research is needed to better map leaders  encoding process  personality system  and be  havioral manifestations  there is complexity for each  especially lea  ders  personality system which can involve a variety of different factors that form leaders  patterns of processing  mischel and shoda   state   the relationships among the person s important encodings  be  liefs and expectations    the enduring goals pursued  the key strategies used  and the affects experienced  all in relation to relevant features of situations  become the terrain  psychologists and leadership researchers  need to map      by presenting situation encoding schemas more fully into the lea  dership domain  a natural question is  what is the value of these schemas relative to what we are already studying  namely leadership traits and behaviors  thus  moving forward  leadership researchers should investigate what variance situation encoding schemas account for above and beyond the leadership traits and behaviors currently studied   additionally  leadership researchers should more fully investigate the relationships between situation encoding schemas and leadership traits and behaviors  are situation encoding schemas antecedents to both leadership traits and behaviors  with leadership traits and beha  viors mediating the relationship between situation encoding schemas and leadership effectiveness   leadership researchers should also investigate the degree to which followers can accurately assess leaders  situation encoding schemas  and what role their evaluations of their schemas plays in their eva  luation of the effectiveness of their leader  mischel and shoda   argue that observers are interested in and sensitive to others  general  ized behavioral tendencies  and are inclined to identify their if then  situation behavior profiles  or what we call situation encoding schemas  thus  this seems like a ripe area for future research  and would add breadth to our understanding of how followers  perceptions of their leaders affect their responsiveness to their leader  as well as their overall work climate   further  it would be valuable to have a clearer understanding sur  rounding the relationships between the four different situation en  coding schemas  it has been theoretically suggested and largely ac  cepted that fixed and growth mindsets lead to the different goal orientations  but there has been little empirical support for this re  lationship    but  we do have empirical evidence that there is a relationship between the goal orientation schemas and the regulatory focus schemas    beyond that  we have little clarity if and how these different schemas may be related  it is thus important to better understand the relationships between schemas  as this would have important devel  opmental implications  if they are related  then perhaps they can be built up simultaneously via broad approaches to improving any situa  tion encoding schemas  if they are more independent  this would sug  gest that organizations need to gain clarity on what specific negative situation encoding schemas their leaders dominantly possess  and pro  vide a tailored developmental program specifically for the most limiting schemas   finally  we acknowledge that the four situation encoding schemas that we have focused on in the present review do not exhaustively encompass the breadth of situation encoding schemas that shape  r k  gottfredson and c s  reina the leadership quarterly             leaders processing and behavioral dispositions  thus  future research should seek to identify other schemas that may influence the cues leaders absorb and correspondingly activate their personality system   methodological considerations there are also important methodological implications that accom   pany our current work  as researchers continue to embrace the situa  tion trait approach and leverage the strengths of the caps framework to guide such research  they will have to give special attention to which measurement techniques they use in order to capture the dynamic nature of situation encoding schemas  one such approach that is especially well suited for this use is experience sampling methodology    utilizing this approach  researchers can capture work behavior from respondents at multiple times during the day in situ    which allows for the investigation of both between  and within person variability of constructs  further benefits of this approach include capturing multiple data points for each variable over time which can reduce the number of third variable explanations and aid researchers in understanding the dynamic relationships between variables     to further disentangle and understand the relationships among the four situation encoding schemas discussed in this review  collecting responses from participants throughout the day to gain insight into how decisions and behaviors result from unique combinations of cognitive and affective states  could prove quite informative in better under  standing how and why leaders do what they do  this within person analysis considers variation in constructs around an individual s own mean level of a construct    and this approach can effectively be paired with trait level measure  ment to model the combined effect of trait and state levels of a con  struct on leader behaviors    in sum  esm is especially well suited for asking and answering research questions in which different types of personal attributes   together inform leader behavior  which is aligned with the complexity and strength of the caps framework   a second methodological approach that could be used to advance research on the four situation encoding schemas is latent profile ana  lysis    this approach is a form of cluster analysis in which researchers can uncover hidden groups that exist within observed data  for example  researchers could ask whether there are certain  clusters  or  signatures  that exist across people in which they exhibit certain levels of each of the four situation encoding schemas  it could be that a unique combination of these schemas can predict additional variance in outcomes above and beyond the actual level of each of the schemas  in other words  latent profile analysis could prove to be an effective tool to expand the study of situation encoding schemas and to uncover any hidden insights that might emerge as a result of considering unique combinations of these schemas  as such  each schema is important by itself  but latent profile analysis would allow researchers to study the combined synergistic effect of multiple schemas together   conclusion  in    antonakis et al  argued that leadership and individual difference research is at a cusp of a renaissance because of new theories and methods to conceptualize and test more complete models of lea  dership  we believe that the shift from the trait approach to the situa  tion trait approach  the identification of situation encoding schemas as foundational components of the leadership process  and the identifi  cation and integration of specific situation encoding schemas is part of this renaissance  together  these contributions are meant to broaden  deepen  and enhance the accuracy of our understanding for why leaders do what they do  leading to important implications for leaders  self  awareness  metacognition  effectiveness  and

longitudinal research multifactor leadership questionnaire  a b s t r a c t  transformational leadership theory represents a cornerstone in leadership research  despite an impressive empirical record highlighted by both the breadth of its nomological network and magnitudes of effects  scholars raise serious construct and content validity concerns  in this article  we address a remarkable oversight in the transformational leadership literature  few studies have assessed the theory assumption that the positive in  dividual  group  and organizational effects of transformational leadership are due to the transformation of fol  lowers in specific and enduring ways  we offer a systematic review of empirical evidence related to follower transformation as the conceptual foundation of transformational leadership theory  findings from this review highlight the radical leap in the evolution of transformational leadership theory from nascent phenomena to mature paradigm  calling for a return to nascent and intermediary phases of theory development  we conclude with a research agenda aimed at creating a stronger theory  better measures  and more actionable leadership models   introduction  transformational leadership theory has garnered substantial scho  larly attention since its inception more than   years ago and continues to be one of the most actively researched leadership paradigms    the notion that leaders transform followers in ways that lead to greater organizational performance provides a compelling conceptual foundation for both research and practice  hundreds of empirical studies support links be  tween transformational leaders and individual  group  and organiza  tional outcomes  making it hard to deny the importance of this con  struct   yet despite its rich history  transformational leadership theory is at a crossroads  on the one hand  critics point out serious flaws in the theory and operationalizations  with some going so far as to call for the abandonment of the construct entirely    on the other  researchers continue to invest efforts to explore new frontiers of this leadership paradigm    the purpose of this review is to explore potential explanations for how the current state of affairs came to be and offer a much needed course correction to the transformational leadership research agenda   our review centers on the notion that follower transformation  represents the key conceptual foundation for transformational leader  ship theory  regardless of the positive outcomes associated with this leadership construct  a leader isn t truly  transformational  unless fol  lowers are transformed  moreover  the utility of transformational lea  dership hinges on follower transformation serving as a mechanism ex  plaining the relationship between leaders and positive organizational outcomes  reviewing the role of follower transformation in transfor  mational leadership scholarship  we note its similarity to a linchpin  a critical and often undervalued fastener that holds a complex mechan  ical system together and whose absence or failure would cause an entire system to malfunction  in engineering parlance  it is critical to test the durability of linchpins early in the design process  we therefore ask  have researchers sufficiently tested the major linchpins of transformational leadership theory   in the section below  we review transformational leadership theory examining existing criticisms and explicating three fundamental as  sumptions related to the role of follower transformation  next  we conduct a systematic literature review to explore whether the field has adequately investigated these assumptions  finding insufficient evi  dence  we draw on edmondson and mcmanus s   theory building

transformational lea  dership theory  we propose a moratorium on theory extending em  pirical research until scholars address a series of difficult yet necessary questions relating to the future of this construct  finally  taking the stance that   transformational leadership theory is not dead but will require considerable efforts to revive and   there are enough re  deeming qualities of this theory to justify a revival  we offer a future research agenda aimed at paving the way for a richer theory  more valid measures  and more actionable theoretical and practical applications of transformational leadership   an overview of the state of transformational leadership theory  forty years after james mcgregor burns introduced the concept of the transforming leader  his ideas continue to have a substantial impact on how we think about and apply leadership theory  simply stated  burns    thesis was that great leaders are transformational in that they  serve as an independent force in changing the makeup of the fol  lowers  motive base      in the decades that followed  leadership scholars sought to refine  expand  and empirically validate a theory of transformational leadership into what has become arguably the most widely researched leadership paradigm    most notable to the evolution of transformational leadership theory was the work of bernard bass and colleagues who helped clarify   the beha  viors that leaders engage in to induce follower transformation    the ways in which leaders transform followers  and   the nexus of out  comes influenced by leader follower interactions     empirical evidence of the predictive validity of transformational leadership has been most impressive  hundreds of primary studies and dozens of meta analyses have consistently produced moderate to strong relationships between transformational leadership and outcomes such as performance  engagement  satisfaction  commitment  and turnover    comparisons to leadership approaches including authentic leadership  ethical leadership  servant leadership  and transactional leadership highlight both strong relative predictive validity and incremental validity of transformational leadership over and above other leadership constructs     despite an impressive empirical record highlighted by both the breadth of its nomological network and magnitudes of effects  trans  formational leadership theory is not without its critics  for instance  van knippenberg and sitkin   liken transformational leadership to the hans christian anderson tale of the emperor s new clothes where a community is blinded by what they expect to see   despite clear evidence to the contrary  they identify four blemishes marring transformational leadership scholarship    the lack of a clear conceptual definition leading to ambiguities regarding the dimensionality of the transformational leader construct    no clear understanding of the causal relationships be  tween leader behaviors  follower responses  and performance out  comes    operationalizations of transformational leaders that con  found leader behaviors with effects  and   transformational leader measures that fail to reproduce the dimensional structure of the the  ories  the authors go as far as to label these issues as  fatal flaws  that are  fundamental and inherent  and call for  abandoning the construct  of transformational leadership entirely     indeed  several scholars have echoed the concerns raised by van knippenberg and sitkin    and while few have gone so far as to argue for abandoning  the construct entirely  it is clear that we do a disservice to the field by discussing the concerns in principle  but ignoring them in practice  our goal in this review is to go beyond simply raising awareness of issues with transformational leadership theory   to clarify how these issues have per  vaded the literature despite so much scholarship   we present an epistemological assessment of transformational lea  dership theory based on a systematic review of the empirical literature  our assessment leads to three major conclusions  first  the field has reached what pfeffer   refers to as high paradigm development  which is characterized by consensually shared beliefs about the nature of a theory and the appropriateness of methods of measurement and empirical validation  pfeffer and others make the argument that para  digm consensus is a necessary although not sufficient condition for the systematic advancement of knowledge  fields with undeveloped paradigms are hampered by construct proliferation that obfuscates communication of new knowledge and makes comparing and accu  mulating findings problematic    as webster and starbuck   note  the scientific value of consensus hinges on the correctness of the paradigm and consensus of a mis specified paradigm could be more damaging than a lack of consensus as the former may result in the advancement of erroneous scientific claims   a second insight from our literature review is that the field has been in what edmondson and mcmanus   refer to as a mature stage of theory development  this stage is characterized by  elegant  complex  and logically rigorous  research   addressing issues that other re  searchers would agree from the outset are worthy of study     importantly  edmondson and mcmanus note that once a field reaches the mature stage of theory development  researchers typically rely heavily on existing constructs and measures and aim to contribute to the theory by adding specificity  introducing new mechanisms  or ex  ploring boundary conditions  related to the above concern regarding the relationship between paradigm consensus and correctness  a fun  damental assumption of mature stage theories is that the field suc  cessfully traversed through earlier developmental stages whereby   new theories are generated and explicated   and   pro  visional empirical support is found for major theoretical propositions and assumptions    our literature review exposes a radical leap of transformational leadership scholarship where the field prematurely advanced from a nascent to mature stage of development with paradigm consensus occurring before scholars exercised due dili  gence examining the major assumptions of transformational leadership theory   our third major conclusion is that there is a relative dearth of em  pirically rigorous research validating the claims that   transforma  tional leaders transform followers in relatively enduring and specific ways and that   follower transformation explains the positive effects of leaders on organizational outcomes  recognizing this oversight and its implications  we call for a program of research that takes transfor  mational leadership theory back to previous stages   where theoretical assumptions are validated and unsupported assumptions are examined and refined   transformational leaders and transformational leadership  before reviewing the transformational leadership literature  a clar  ification on the distinction between the concept of transformational leaders and that of transformational leadership is necessary  following the recommendations of day and colleagues    we recognize the importance of making a conceptual distinction between the intrapersonal study of leaders and the interpersonal study of leadership  we extend this ob  servation to transformational leadership theory where we attempt to disentangle what we know about transformational leaders           categorization  from what we know about transformational leadership      while scholars have created parallel models and alternate measures of transformational leaders    previous reviews of the literature highlight the considerable conceptual and empirical overlap    for the sake of brevity  we refer to the bass and avolio   dimensional labels of transformational leaders unless otherwise noted as they are the most recognizable and are frequently synony  mized with transformational leaders  according to this model  the ex  tent to which leaders are considered transformational is a function of four leader dimensions    idealized influence      inspirational motivation      intellectual stimulation    and   individualized consideration     while much of the scholarship in this area focuses on studying the impact of transformational leaders  attributes and behaviors on work outcomes  original conceptualizations of the theory emphasize a pro  cess oriented  leadership oriented focus  in one of his earliest works on conceptualizing transformational leadership theory  bass proposed transformational leadership as the process through which leaders  broaden and elevate the interests of their employees  generate awareness and acceptance of the purposes and mission of the group  and stir their employees to look beyond their own self interests for the good of the group      the stipulation that follower transformation is at the core of transformational leadership was further explicated by subsequent scholars  podsakoff et al     for instance  in describing early at  tempts to define transformational leadership    argued that a common theme among these early perspectives is that   transformational  leaders transform or change the basic values  be  liefs  and attitudes of followers so that they are willing to perform be  yond the minimum levels specified by the organizations     as more recent scholars noted  the essence of transformational leadership theory is a process whereby the leader builds followers  commitment to organizational objectives and develops followers to be able to accom  plish organizational goals    put simply  transformational leaders influence the devel  opment and transformation of their followers  the result  at least in theory  is the enhancement of follower performance  and subsequently  organizational performance  beyond expectations     follower transformation as the linchpin of transformational leadership theory  despite so much scholarship of transformational leadership to date  the transformation of followers remains one of the most critical and understudied elements of this leadership paradigm  this oversight is unfortunate given burns  assertion that  the extent of real change in  followers  must be investigated  not assumed      emphasizing the process oriented focus of transformational leadership  our review centers on the notion that follower transformation represents an indispensable conceptual foun  dation of transformational leadership theory  given the relative mileage of transformational leadership research  we propose that a critical evaluation of this linchpin is long overdue   drawing on bass s   con  ceptualization of transformational leadership  we focus on follower transformation and identify three underlying assumptions of transfor  mational leadership theory      leaders are responsible for relatively enduring change   in followers      followers are transformed in specific ways     the systematic  relatively enduring change in followers explains the  process through which leaders achieve positive workplace results   in the sections below  we discuss each assumption and describe examples of evidence that would provide support  then  we system  atically review the literature to determine whether the field has gar  nered support for the underlying assumptions of transformational lea  dership   assumption    leaders transform followers   transformational leadership theory is grounded in the assumption that followers transform as the result of their experience with certain leaders  burns   describes the qualities of transformation as in  volving  real change  in terms of   the magnitude of change  fol  lowers  attitudes and values need be transformed to a  marked degree   and   persistence of change  change should be relatively enduring rather than fleeting  while this assumption is perhaps the simplest and most intuitive of the three  the difficulty comes in testing this as  sumption since it requires that researchers utilize study designs pow  erful enough to model change  this involves both complex analytical research methodologies and repeated measurement of variables that are expected to change and remain changed over time    in this regard  our test of the first assumption involves identifying whether transformational leadership research has employed research designs suitable for asses  sing follower transformation   assumption    followers transform in specific ways   a second fundamental assumption of transformational leadership theory is that transformational leaders stimulate particular transfor  mations in followers  as a historian and political scientist  james burns  original conceptualization of transformational leadership laid the groundwork for how societal transformations might occur  subsequent work by bass and colleagues applied transformational leadership to organizational contexts and specified how employees are transformed  in particular  bass   described three specific aspects of a follower s self concept that are impacted by transformational leaders        collective identification  followers develop a sense of belonging to the team or organization and see the collective as an important part of their personal identity      value internalization  followers align their personal values with the    in van knippenberg and sitkin s   critique of transformational lea  dership  the authors argue that disentangling the process of transformational leadership from the way in which transformational leaders are evaluated is difficult due to the dominance of the mlq in transformational leadership re  search  stating   transformational leadership is de facto defined as what the mlq measures      from this position  they provide a critique of transformational leadership that largely hinges on issues with con  ceptualizing and operationalizing transformational leader attributes and be  haviors    while we recognize the seriousness of the authors  major criticisms  we take the perspective that disentangling the concept of transformational leaders from transformational leadership theory is   pos  sible    necessary due to what van knippenberg identify as  fundamental flaws  in the transformational leader paradigm  and   useful in guiding so  lutions to overcoming these concerns  we return to this issue in the discussion section   n  siangchokyoo  et al  the leadership quarterly             values of the team or organization     self efficacy  followers develop a heightened sense of their ability  and potential to accomplish their task   to test this assumption  we explore whether research has in  vestigated the link between transformational leaders and these three specific constructs  it should be noted that several additional mediating mechanisms have been proposed and empirically investigated by lea  dership scholars  we do not intend to devalue the important work that has been done to extend transformational leadership theory beyond its original form  rather  our aim is to explore what has not been done  in terms of empirically validating the foundational assumptions of this theory upon which paradigm consensus and subsequent theory ex  tending research is grounded    assumption    followers transformation is responsible for the effectiveness of transformational leadership   transformational leadership theory was designed to explain var  iance in leadership effectiveness  whereas the previous two evaluations focus on validating the claim that transformational leaders create sys  tematic and enduring changes in followers  the final assessment ex  plores the extent to which the field has adequately tested whether these systematic  enduring follower transformations account for the benefits associated with transformational leaders  in other words  a key in  dicator of the effectiveness of transformational leadership would be evidence that the transformation of followers represents the process through which transformational leaders influence positive individual  group  and organizational outcomes  in sum  the veracity and utility of transformational leadership scholarship hinges on a few critical as  sumptions  in the next section  we explore three features of the litera  ture      choices related to research design  has the field employed appro  priate research designs to capture enduring follower transforma  tions      choices related to study variables  has the field explored systematic follower change according to theory propositions        choices related to data analysis  has the field captured systematic  enduring follower transformations analyzed whether these trans  formations account for the effectiveness of transformational lea  ders   to be clear  we do not intend to appraise individual scholars  choices or imply that investigations that do not test these assumptions are necessarily inferior  we assess the collective choices of the field to examine the  stability of the foundation upon which paradigm con  sensus and mature stage  theory extending research rests   method  a systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies for inclusion in our review  using  transformational leadership  as the keyword  we followed fischer  dietz  and antonakis   screening criteria by searching online databases   for ar  ticles that were published before february   in twenty five journals known to publish leadership research    while we could have limited our search only to studies published since      we did not want to exclude studies that may have also investigated earlier conceptualizations of the trans  forming leader    the initial screening yielded   articles   we then vetted full texts to confirm the relevance of each study  we applied three inclusion criteria during this screening process  first  the study had to be empirical and original research with transformational leadership being one of the focal studied variables    second  since the dimen  sions of transformational leadership are thought to be formative rather than reflective indicators   where the  whole  is conceptually different from any subset of  parts   we excluded studies that only captured a partial set of trans  formational leadership dimensions  for instance  a study by koseoglu  liu  and shalley   was excluded because only intellectual stimu  lation was measured  we also excluded studies that examined trans  formational leadership as a context   as they did not measure the direct effects of transformational leaders     applying these criteria  we identified   primary studies reporting empirical tests of transformational leadership  since the focus of our analysis is on follower transformation  we coded studies wherein a follower psychological transformation was directly measured  this ex  cluded studies that measured transformational leader s direct influence on organizational outcomes    studies that only ex  amined antecedents of the leader s attributes and behaviors    studies that used transformational leadership as an element of the nomological network of other variables    and scale validation studies     we should also note that while the transformational leadership lit  erature has been largely dominated by bass s full range leadership model and the use of the multifactor leadership questionnaire    we included studies that relied on other transformational leadership measures and models   to ensure we provided a complete representation of the state of transformational leadership research  applying these criteria  we reduced our sample by    yielding a final sample of   relevant articles  in the next section  we discuss our approach for categorizing studies on follower transformation based on the three assumptions of transformational leadership theory   categorization  in table    we present our categorization of the articles in this re  view  note that the number of articles in the far right column   constitutes studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria of assessing follower transformation  we present this number to provide a more complete illustration of the transformational leadership research and to demonstrate the proportion of empirical research on follower trans  formation to the overall transformational leadership literature   in order to more effectively and systematically evaluate the trans  formational leadership literature according to the three assumptions of transformational leadership theory  we categorized the articles in the following way  first  to address the first assumption  we focused on    a post hoc assessment of our article database revealed that      of the empirical studies in our review cited at least one of the works that developed the three psychological mechanisms as key mediators in the transformational leadership process    moreover  several studies explicitly identified these mechanisms as the unmeasured phenomena explaining the relationship between their measured transformational leader and outcome variables in the theoretical development of their work     n  siangchokyoo  et al  the leadership quarterly             overall research design and assessed how scholars have treated or ex  amined follower change  we applied ployhart and vandenberg s   recommendations for analyzing change by categorizing studies based on the frequency and timing in which the focal follower transformation variables were measured  in particular  empirically capturing change requires a  longitudinal  study in which data related to the focal variable theorized to change is collected over three or more time points or waves separated by a sensible unit of time  ployhart and vandenberg provide two reasons for why fewer than three measures of a focal variable is insufficient to capture change    first  it takes at least three measures to accurately model the trajectory of change  with two or fewer measures  change is assumed to be linear  more critically  with only two measures of a focal variable  it is not possible to decompose true change from measurement error  accordingly  we submit that  longitudinal  studies provide the stron  gest test of the first assumption of transformational leadership   while not truly longitudinal by the most conservative definitions    singer and willett   consider two  wave repeated measure designs to be incrementally better than re  search that does not capture a focal variable across multiple time per  iods    therefore  for research that utilized repeated measures  we differentiate  longitudinal  from  two wave  quasi longitudinal studies    another form of quasi longitudinal research design that provides only preliminary support for the theoretically argued longitudinal ef  fects involves separating   measurement of the focal change variable  from causes and or effects    in accordance  for studies that do not capture repeated measures of follower transforma  tion  we differentiate those that include  temporal separation  of the  leader evaluation and focal follower transformation variable  from  single time  studies that assume rather than attempt to assess follower change   testing of the second assumption involved coding the follower transformation variables captured by each study  particularly  we coded whether the study focused on examining follower transformation ac  cording to bass s theoretical propositions    identification with the collective     value internalization  and    self efficacy or whether the scholars attempted to extend this theory by testing additional follower variables   the final assumption frames follower transformations as the ex  planatory mechanism of the relationship between transformational leaders and work outcomes  to test this assumption  we coded whether the study treated focal follower variable  as mediator and explicitly analyzed the mediation effect  in this regard  an  ideal study  testing the assumptions of transformational leadership would   incorporate a repeated measures design powerful enough to capture enduring change in the follower    measuring specific  theoretically posited follower changes  and   modeling follower change as a mediating mechanism explaining the relationship between transformational leaders and work outcomes   results  table   presents a visualization of empirical evidence related to the assumptions of transformational leadership theory  surprisingly  of the   primary empirical studies on transformational leadership from our literature search  only   studies   directly assessed at least one assumption  notably  we were only able to locate two studies that as  sessed elements of all three assumptions   tests of all three assumptions  in a field study of employees from a large multinational bank in hong kong  schaubroeck et al    used a three wave longitudinal design to explore whether employees  changes in beliefs about the benefits of customer service   and per  ceived behavioral control   mediated the effects of transformational leaders on employee work performance  overall  schaubroeck et al    found support for the assumption that transformational leaders change followers in specific and enduring ways  however  the authors only found partial support for the as  sumption that follower transformation explained the link between transformational leaders and job performance  the test of mediation was significant for follower value internalization  but not self efficacy   in another longitudinal field study involving multiple observations of follower psychological variables over time  tims et al    as  sessed the extent to which transformational leaders impact followers  daily self efficacy and optimism levels  data on followers were collected over five consecutive days  while followers  perceptions of transfor  mational leaders were found to be positively related to follower day  level optimism  the same effect was not observed for follower self ef  ficacy  in testing the mediating effects of these follower psychological variables  support was found only for follower optimism to serve as a mediator for the relationship between transformational leaders and follower work engagement   across the two direct tests of all three assumptions of transforma  tional leadership theory  both studies failed to support the importance of follower self efficacy  equally important is that neither study tested the importance of follower collective identification in relation to transformational leaders  it must be noted  however  that theory testing is a collective effort  our goal is to assess whether the field  as a whole  has sufficiently scrutinized the assumptions of transformational lea  dership theory  in this regard  along with the two above mentioned studies  we were able to identify four additional studies that tested the first assumption regarding the dynamic nature of transformational  table   journals used for systematic literature review of transformational leadership research   journal number of article  initial inquiry

not only influenced by transformational leaders but that they also explain the association be  tween transformational leaders and follower work engagement  in a follow up study  breevaart et al    relied on data collected from employees in the business service and healthcare sector once a week over the course of five consecutive weeks to extend the mediational pathway from transformational leadership to job performance through work engagement  a third study of employees from a large interna  tional brewer in the netherlands again collected weekly measures of follower psychological

in followers  experience of positive emo  tions  on the other hand  transformational leaders had no impact on followers  experiences of negative emotions or reports of emotional regulation over time   a few general observations regarding tests of the first assumption of transformational leadership theory deserve attention    first  of the   articles that directly measured variables associated with follower transformations      relied on a measure of  follower transformation captured at a single time point and measured the transformational leadership variable at the same time  second  across the   studies where researchers temporally separated mea  surement of leaders and followers and the   studies where repeated measurements were used to capture changes in the follower  results were generally supportive of the assumption that transformational leaders transform followers  table   provides an overview of each of the longitudinal studies discussed above along with studies that employed either quasi longitudinal or experimental research designs  this table includes only the   studies in our review that included tests capable of capturing or inferring change  of the   distinct tests of follower psy  chological variables measured in a way that either directly captures change   or allows for an inference of change        were statistically significant in the hypothesized direction  therefore  we find partial support or assumption     one potential moderator of this association may be the unit of time over which the relationship was observed  the separation of time be  tween measures of transformational leaders and follower psychological variables ranged from minutes   to hours   to days   to weeks   to months    of the four studies that

to ground extensions of transformational leadership theory to novel research questions    in relatively few articles are these variables directly measured rather than assumed    moreover  only eight of these studies employed a research design that involves either repeated  measures of follower transformation variables or temporal separation with measures manipulations of transformational leaders      in the only study to simultaneously explore all three of bass s pro  posed follower psychological transformations  dvir et al    con  ducted a field experimental study to assess the extent to which military leaders in israel s defense forces who completed transformational lea  dership training would transform infantry subordinates  their findings failed to support the second assumption concerning follower transfor  mation  in fact  infantry personnel supervised by leaders who attended the transformational leadership intervention regressed in several of their personal developments over the   month timeframe   on the other hand  hannah et al    utilized a two wave  re  peated measures field study design to explore the impact of transfor  mational leadership on united states army infantry personnel s value internalization and self efficacy  over the   week study window  hannah et al    found evidence that not only did transformational leaders positively influence the development of these two follower psychological variables  but both self efficacy and value internalization mediated the relationship between transformational leaders and leader  rated followers  infantry performance   summarizing the set of articles from table    we find a general lack of support for the second assumption  considering the four studies that rely on repeated measures field study or experimental research designs to study bass s proposed follower psychological transformation  the only one to explore collective identification   failed to find support  of the three that assessed value internalization  again one   failed to find support  finally  two of the four   assessments of follower self efficacy were not supported   consistent with the notion that the field is in a mature stage of  theory development where theory extensions outpace tests of theory assumptions  the majority of articles that empirically assess follower change explore novel follower psychological variables   as opposed to those proposed by bass during early stages of theory de  velopment    in table   alone    different follower psy  chological variables are explored  including trust in leader    felt obligation to the work unit    and work engagement     tests of assumption    only seven out of   primary empirical studies on transforma  tional leadership from our literature search directly test the third as  sumption  that the specific  enduring follower transformations explain a pathway through which transformational leaders produce positive work outcomes  while the results for value internalization and collective identification are generally supportive of this assumption  self efficacy plays a more tenuous role  in four cases    re  searchers failed to find support for the role of this follower psycholo  gical variable   discussion  our systematic literature review revealed a relative dearth of em  pirical attempts to validate all three major assumptions of the follower transformation linchpin of transformational leadership theory  moreover  the limited evidence that does exist raises serious concerns with several generally accepted components of this theory  in light of our results  it is clear that we have not tested this theory with sufficient rigor and face inadequate evidence to justify paradigm consensus   the distribution of studies in table   emphasizes transformational leadership s status as what edmondson and mcmanus   refer to as mature stage theory development  this should come as no surprise given the theory s rich  forty year history  we would  thus  expect the ob  servation that the majority of recent empirical investigations build upon paradigm consensus by extending the domain of mediating me  chanisms and outcomes associated with transformational leaders   to further explore the historical development of this theory  we  fig     empirical research on transformational leadership by year since bass s conceptualization  note  numbers represent articles obtained from   journals   n  siangchokyoo  et al  the leadership quarterly             present a visual depiction of the accumulation of empirical transfor  mational leadership research in fig     counter to expectations based on edmondson and mcmanus s   evolution of theory development was the anachronistic nature of the limited evidence that does exist regarding theory assumptions  instead of testing assumptions early in the lifecycle of transformational leadership theory  in what edmondson and mcmanus refer to as intermediate stage theory development  almost all tests of assumptions related to the linchpin of follower transforma  tion occurred in the last decade  in fact  of the   articles that measure variables related to follower transformation with a research design that captures change through either repeated measures or temporal se  paration  only two were published during the   year period following publication of bass s influential development of the modern paradigm of transformational leadership   our review paints a picture of a radical leap from nascent theory to universally accepted paradigm  where the predictive power of the theory overshadowed its explanatory power  our critical evaluation of the linchpin of transformational leadership raises significant concerns about previous interpretations and future applications of this theory  applying kuhn s   philosophical work on the structure of scien  tific revolutions  the transformational leadership literature seems to be in a crisis of confidence  as such  we recognize the need for an inter  vention characterized by directly confronting four difficult questions   is transformational leadership dead   before offering a proposed agenda for future research  we must first tackle the question   is there a future in transformational leadership research   fig    presents disconcerting trends regarding recent scho  larship and the outlook of this leadership theory  first  following a period of exponential growth in the  s and  s  annual publica  tions of empirical transformational leadership peaked in    over the last three years  the rate of publication has declined by over     moreover  while paradigm consensus at the theory level remains strong  there appears to have been a substantive shift away from   rather than towards paradigm consensus at the operational level  no fewer than thirteen different operationalizations of transformational leadership were identified in our literature review  in    more than    of empirical studies utilized a single measure of transformational leaders the mlq  by    the number has decreased year over year to      one might identify rational explanations for these trends  for instance  it could be that access to free  publicly available  and psy  chometrically sound measures of transformational leadership   have spurred the relative decline in mlq popularity  however  it is hard to ignore the role that scathing criticisms of fundamental flaws in trans  formational leadership theory in conjunction with the introduction of newer  shinier leadership constructs have played in this precipitously declining trend  if transformational leadership is not dead  it is surely dying  if steps are not taken to address the conditions responsible for its decline  a full recovery to previous levels of activity seems a foolish prognosis   should we revive transformational leadership theory   given the issues raised in this and other reviews  we must consider  the rationality in attempting to salvage transformational leadership theory  on the one hand  as merton   noted  the hallmark of science is in its self correction in the pursuit of truth and knowledge  on the other hand  there is a sea of difference between correcting a single scientific claim and correcting a theory that enjoyed paradigm con  sensus for more than twenty years and has been referenced or directly tested in nearly all leadership scholarship outlets to date  even if pos  sible  reviving transformational leadership theory will involve a her  culean effort   up to this point  our findings and recommendations dovetail with van knippenberg and sitkin s   critique of transformational lea  dership  here  we note a first significant divergence  weighing the da  mages  van knippenberg and sitkin   recommend completely abandoning transformational leadership  we wonder whether such an approach represents  throwing the baby out with the bathwater   if it can be salvaged  we see redeeming qualities in the underlying foun  dation of transformational leadership theory as an explanation for the process through which leaders play a role in transforming followers into qualitatively superior employees  as lewin   famously quipped   there is nothing as practical as good theory   it is our perspective that transformational leadership  as envisioned by burns  is a good theory that has been part of the collective consciousness of organizational science for decades  this is perhaps due to the parsimony of its senti  ment that leaders can transform followers  ultimately aligning the goals of the followers with the goals of the collective organization to incite greater performance at individual  group  and organizational levels  the foundation of transformational leadership theory elegant in its simplicity is strong  yet our review highlights significant concerns with the structural integrity of the levels built upon its foundation  in particular  the specification and operationalization of   leader beha  viors that elicit follower transformation and   systematic ways in which followers are transformed   reviews of similar leadership theories most saliently  authentic leadership   and servant leadership   have highlighted these fields  difficulties progressing to mature stage research due to the proliferation of parallel perspectives  propositions  and operationalizations during early stages of theory development    despite the growing pains associated with the maturation process  alternative perspectives can create a  survival of  the fittest  research mentality which fosters opportunities for discovery and pruning weak ideas through competition for empirical support    we note that the transformational leadership field suffers from diametric issues  not enough competition of ideas and acceptance of major assumptions at face value  while we take the stance that transformational leadership is  good theory   we question whether we have satisficed along the way by bypassing the conflict often associated with typical early stage research paradigms   can we revive transformational leadership theory   van knippenberg and sitkin   s criticisms rest on their asser  tion that it is impossible to disentangle operationalizations of trans  formational leader behaviors from the process of transformational leadership  a second significant diversion from their critique is that we see disentanglement as a difficult but necessary step to reviving trans  formational leadership  one doesn t have to stray far from the trans  formational leadership literature to identify an example of scholars working through the labors of reviving a construct that suffers from the lack of a clear separation between the attributes and behaviors of lea  ders and their theorized outcomes    using signaling theory as the foundation  antonakis et al    re conceptualized charisma as a set of signals  thus offering a more precise definition of charisma without the tautological risks inherent in previous definitions  trans  formational leadership historically faces similar threats to its validity     a further analysis of trends in operationalizations of transformational lea  dership warrants two observations  first  the decline in mlq usage was almost entirely offset by an increase in usage of podsakoff et al  s   transfor  mational leadership inventory  no other operationalization of transformational leadership has been used in more than    of empirical studies of transforma  tional leadership  second  even when researchers use measures other than the mlq  they often convert non mlq measures into the dimensional labels used by the mlq or suggest scale equivalence     n  siangchokyoo  et al  the leadership quarterly             antonakis et al    write   charisma is a values based  symbolic  and emotion laden leader signaling     thus strategically separ  ating the intent of the leader from the real effect  such segregation of leader behavior from the influence the leader actually wields is ad  ditionally noted in research detailing the process through which in  dividuals claim leadership via behaviors and others grant those in  dividuals leadership due in part to perceptions of effective influence    we must not forget that while follower transformation is central to transformational leadership  so too is the leader   a final significant departure from van knippenberg and sitkin   is that where they offer a description of major flaws in trans  formational leadership theory  we suggest reasons for the why these issues arose  importantly  embedded in the  why s  are opportunities to address these flaws     if the transformational leadership field made a radical leap from nascent theory to mature stage research  then we need to change course by mandating a moratorium on extending transformational leadership theory until we accumulate sufficient evidence of the major theory propositions regarding follower transformation     if new evidence fails to support major propositions of transforma  tional leadership theory  then we need to revert to nascent stage research characterized by qualitative studies and iterative theory  building efforts     if we are revising major tenets of transformational leadership theory  then we need to make sure revisions address current short  comings  most notably  conceptual ambiguity regarding the dis  tinction between the process of transformational leadership and the qualities actions of transformational leaders     if new theory is constructed  then we need to focus on devising and testing new operationalizations of theory constructs   these suggestions are grounded in a systematic  deliberate de evo  lution   and subsequent re  evolution through edmondson and mcmanus s   conventional stages of theory development   through this journey  we are afforded the luxury of being able to learn from previous gaffes by valuing longitudinal research designs that allow for direct tests of follower transformation and assuring that the challenges of each developmental stage are met before advancing to the aims of subsequent stages  ad  mittedly  this is easier said than done   how do we revive transformational leadership theory   in this section  we offer several specific avenues of future research that could contribute to tearing transformational leadership down to its foundation and rebuilding stronger theory  better measures  and more actionable leader and leadership models  until the major transforma  tional leadership issues are rectified and new paradigm consensus is achieved  we think it is prudent to refrain from theory extension re  search grounded in untested assumptions regarding both the  operationalization of transformational leaders and the process of fol  lower transformations   the most obvious extension of this literature review is the need for rigorous tests of paradigm assumptions  our literature review is meant to guide researchers regarding choices related to research design  study variables  and analytic strategies  in particular  we hope that as future research drawing on longitudinal and experimental designs and mod  eling changes in follower s collective identification  value internaliza  tion  and self efficacy accumulate  the field can better assess anomalies in the transformational leadership paradigm  a meta analysis of the transformational leadership process model would be an excellent way to probe major paradigm assumptions   while our review differs from previous critiques in terms of its focus on the follower transformation process rather than transformational leader attributes and behaviors  it must be stated that rebuilding con  fidence in transformational leadership theory will require rectifying both issues  if  for instance  the mlq and other measures of transfor  mational leader dimensions are flawed  then interpreting evidence for follower transformation   is ill advised   in this regard  we suggest that even testing the assumptions of transforma  tional leadership theory   may be premature  in  stead  we call for a return to the nascent stage of theory development  characterized by the application of inductive research methodologies   in returning to the nascent stage  our goal would be to re examine the intrapersonal and interpersonal dynamics between leaders and followers with a focus on   the ways that followers are transformed and   the behaviors that induce these transformations  a key ad  vantage of going back to the nascent stage is that it requires the use of inductive research  inductive studies would be particularly beneficial to the criticisms we present in this review because they allow researchers to capture and flesh out follower psychological variables that reflect the critical and enduring changes initiated by transformational leaders  these may include observations of leader follower interactions to identify transformational leader behaviors and interviews with fol  lowers to pinpoint the ways in which followers internalize the trans  formational efforts of their leaders  by applying grounded theory    transformational leadership scholars would stay as close to the natural phenomenon as possible  allowing themes to emerge organically  through an inductive study of this theory  we may find that follower psychological variables alternative to the three that were originally theorized are transformed by leaders and new re  lationships among transformed variables more deeply explain how leaders transform their followers  further  utilizing  member checks    is the first obstacle to validity of this revived transfor  mational leadership   another primary advantage of the grounded theory is the iterative approach between qualitative data and the literature because it can situate emerging concepts within the nomological framework of ex  isting constructs  doing so allows for inclusion of previously identified ways in which followers transform  for example  bommer  rich  and rubin   found that transformational leadership was able to reduce their followers  cynicism about organizational change  moreover  duan et al    found that by strengthening follower perceptions that their voices mattered  transformational leaders were able to increase their likelihood that their followers would engage in voice behavior   perhaps an ideal nascent study to investigate follower transforma  tions and begin to examine attributes and behaviors of transformational leaders is through a longitudinal qualitative diary study wherein par  ticipants are prompted to reflect each evening on daily experiences with their leader    such a study design presents an opportunity to    while edmondson and mcmanus   offer a useful prescriptive approach to paradigm development  we note that scientific philosopher thomas kuhn presents a more descriptive account of how  normal science  occurs  in his treatise on scientific revolution  kuhn   suggests that once researchers accept a paradigm  they typically take theoretical assumptions for granted until a crisis of confidence occurs  at that stage  scientists either probe assumptions until the crisis is resolved or abandon the paradigm for new paradigms  re  sulting in scientific revolution  both approaches lead to a similar explanation for the current state of affairs uncovered in this review   and offer a similar call to action to address anomalies that have been uncovered  however  according to kuhn  the history of trans  formational leadership scholarship is closer to the norm than an exception  we thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out    we thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out  n  siangchokyoo  et al  the leadership quarterly             unveil how followers internalize the values espoused by the transfor  mational leaders over time  research on learning and development demonstrate that internalization may not be a one time phenomenon  instead  repetition and practice encourage the internalization process    qualitative research  including a series of interviews or daily weekly diary studies  are particularly advantageous in capturing this type of information   of course  in their daily reflections  followers would also identify particularly influential leader behaviors  allowing us to expand and refine our conceptualization of a transformational leader  in a similar example  egri and herman   interviewed more than   leaders  conducted a content analysis of the responses and while they identified the notable  four i s   they also found evidence of additional transfor  mational leader behaviors including collaboration  empowerment  and two way communication  while these scholars used self reported lea  dership styles  it is still illustrative of the opportunities for transfor  mational leadership scholarship provided by inductive research   a solid foundation built via grounded theory provides the stability for transformational leadership theory to evolve  the next hurdle for this theory is to replicate and extend the relationships found using in  ductive research  though this review does raise awareness that re  plications of transformational leadership assumptions are lacking  it does not address more systemic problems related to the lack of in  centives to publish replications  as koole and lakens   note  un  less journals become more open to publishing replications and scholars begin citing replications  there is little incentive for researchers to al  locate efforts to replication studies  in this regard  we applaud recent efforts from editors of management science journals to communicate the value of replications and create avenues for replication studies to be published     scholars also need to test and refine main assumptions on the path to new paradigm consensus  mixed methodologies are best equipped to do this  an example mixed method study focusing on follower trans  formation would test potential mediators identified via inductive stu  dies  complementing traditional quantitative approaches to theory  testing with qualitative interviews to open up the black box of follower transformation  rarely have we considered the dynamic process through which follower transformation occurs   a hallmark of these types of studies   is the integration of distinct and re  levant theories to help explain previously or currently unexplainable processes and organize theoretical predictions  scholars have pre  viously recommended theories such as social learning theory    social exchange theory    and social identity theory   to explain why transformational leader behaviors result in positive follower psycholo  gical changes  inherent in these are social experiences and while there is no doubt that leadership is interactive  the effects of leadership  those bass and others have proposed transform followers  are likely less in  trapersonal and more interpersonal  this distinction introduces oppor  tunities to integrate other established theories to further illustrate how leaders influence followers    such as self  regulation theory   and the  ories about emotions     addressing the myriad issues with this theory will be a time con  suming journey requiring a collaborative effort  however  we recognize the opportunity inherent in remodeling a theory with such a simple  intuitive  and practicable base  we hope that by drawing on previous leadership research  focusing on follower transformation as the nexus of our understanding of the transformational leadership process during nascent theory building phases of research  and remaining cognizant of the important milestones in the development of theoretical paradigms  we may create a richer theory of transformational leadership   conclusion  in closing  our systematic literature review raises concerns about the development of transformational leadership theory and the lack of empirical evidence for fundamental assumptions regarding follower transformation  given the current state of the literature  we hope to stimulate difficult conversations about the future of transformational leadership

spanning group social capital multiteam systems intergroup relations  a b s t r a c t  research on team leadership has primarily focused on leadership processes targeted within teams  in support of team objectives  yet  teams are open systems that interact with other teams to achieve proximal as well as distal goals  this review clarifies that defining  what  constitutes functionally effective leadership in interteam contexts requires greater precision with regard to where   and why   leadership processes are enacted  as well as greater consideration of when and among whom leadership processes arise  we begin by synthesizing findings from empirical studies published over the past   years that shed light on questions of what  where  why  when  and who related to interteam leadership and end by providing three overarching recommendations for how research should proceed in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of leadership in interteam contexts   the use of teams  in organizations is ubiquitous    and thus  a primary function of organizational leadership is to facilitate team success    prior research on team leadership has focused primarily on identifying functional   leadership processes and relationships within teams without considering the larger systems within which teams are embedded    however  no team is a  self sufficient island  teams must in  teract with and receive resources from their embedding environments in order to succeed    indeed  formal as well as informal team leaders often engage in boundary management activities to support their teams  such as acquiring external resources  promoting team  interests  or interpreting the embedding environment    and lea  dership is also needed to influence collaborative efforts across inter  dependent systems comprised of multiple teams pursuing shared goals     despite many calls for researchers to adopt an  external  perspective to the study of team leadership by conceptualizing teams as  open systems entailing complex interactions with people beyond their bor  ders     research on leadership in interteam con  texts is relatively rare  for instance  studies based on the leadership theories that have received the most research attention in recent dec  ades    the national institutes of health    and the national aeronautics and space administration    we would like to thank kristen campbell for her assistance with identifying articles that were considered for inclusion in earlier versions of this paper   ⁎ corresponding author  e mail addresses                                   in this paper  the term  teams  is used interchangeably with the term  groups   we acknowledge that there are often important distinctions between teams and  groups in terms of the level of internal interdependence among members and the differentiation of members  tasks    however  in the context of organizations  the similarities between teams and work groups are more relevant to the content discussed     the leadership quarterly        available online   january        ©   elsevier inc  all rights reserved   t                            exchange theory  lmx   c f  dinh et al       typically investigate the role of intragroup leadership processes and relationships for individuals and small groups  these studies seldom consider how the multilayered interdependencies inherent to interteam situations   coupled with differences in the priorities  identities  and cap  abilities of different teams need to be managed in order to minimize intergroup conflict and maximize positive outcomes for specific teams and the larger systems they operate within   the relative lack of research attention paid toward leadership in interteam contexts is unfortunate given that such contexts present serious challenges and tensions for leaders that go beyond the demands of leadership within isolated teams  for instance  leaders operating in interteam contexts often face trade offs and competing demands and may choose to promote intrateam relations and team goals at the ex  pense of interteam relations and system goals  or vice versa    interteam contexts may also require that leaders facil  itate appropriate patterns of interactions between interdependent teams   while avoiding  over collaboration  between teams which can result in inefficiencies  role overload and decreased motivation    these tensions are not captured adequately by models of team leadership that focus primarily on lea  dership processes targeted within teams in support of team level ob  jectives   we propose that defining  functional  leadership becomes more complex when researchers shift from studying leadership within iso  lated teams to studying leadership in interteam contexts where teams are embedded in larger interdependent systems  as fig    illustrates  defining functional leadership in interteam contexts not only involves clarifying  what  leaders are  or should be  doing     who  is leading   and  when     the multi level nature of interteam contexts also demands more consideration of  where  leadership processes are tar  geted   and  why      using this framework to guide our review  we evaluate the degree to which empirical studies of leadership and or the targets of leadership   published over the past   years have addressed questions of why  where  what  who  and when related to leadership in interteam contexts  although most lea  dership studies have taken an  internal  perspective  several burgeoning streams of research in areas such as group boundary spanning    group social ca  pital    boundary spanning leadership    intergroup leadership    and multiteam systems   are heeding calls to incorporate an external perspective by  investigating leadership processes targeted across team boundaries  indeed  our review reveals that researchers have provided many in  sightful answers to the five questions in fig      however  we also identified a number of limitations  assumptions  and divisions which pervade the extant literature on leadership in in  terteam contexts  prior research has tended to progress in divergent directions  as evidenced by researchers  use of different terminology    examination of different types of interteam inter  actions    interteam coordination  davison  hollenbeck  barnes  sleesman    ilgen      and focus on objectives at different collective levels of observation    studies within disparate re  search streams are revealing different pieces of the larger puzzle of functional leadership in interteam contexts  our review aims to bring these puzzle pieces together in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this important phenomenon  in closing  we offer three recommendations for how future integrative research might provide greater insight into how leaders   can navigate the tensions of interteam contexts and promote the success of both teams and the broader organizational systems teams operate within   review approach  the purpose of this review is to clarify the nature of functional leadership in interteam contexts  integrate and critically evaluate re  levant findings from prior research  and identify promising areas for future inquiry  broadly  leadership is defined as a  process of influen  cing others to understand and agree about what needs to be done and how to do it  and the process of facilitating individual and collective efforts to accomplish shared objectives     thus  lea  dership processes are situated in relation to specific individuals and or collectives   and are enacted to facilitate specific objectives    as we depict in fig     these two questions of where and why are useful for organizing studies of leadership processes in intergroup contexts into four categories   as shown in the first quadrant   of fig     leadership processes might be targeted within teams   in support of team level objectives    the vast majority of empirical studies of leadership fall within category    examples include studies of team leaders supporting team learning and adaptation    shared team leadership and team performance    the effects of transformational leaders on the effec  tiveness of individuals and teams    and the dynamic delegation of leadership responsibility within teams     however  leadership processes targeted across team boundaries in support of team level objectives   as well as leadership  where is leadership targeted   leadership within  teams  system  outcomes   team  outcomes    processes and states  across teams  what processes and states targeted  why     when    does leadership occur   who is leading   leadership across  team boundaries  processes and states

quarterly             processes targeted within   and across   team boundaries in support of system level objectives are also critical to or  ganizational success  many scholars have emphasized that  external  or  cross boundary  leadership behaviors that connect teams to entities and resources in their embedding environments represent a critical category of functional leadership behaviors for teams    balkundi   harrison     choi     contractor  dechurch  carson  carter    keegan     elkins   keller     marrone     oh  labianca    chung     van knippenberg     yan   louis     yukl     zaccaro et al       further  many important objectives  including patient care    disaster response    new product development    and military operations    represent distal goals that require leadership processes to guide coordinated ef  forts within and across multiple teams     literature search  we used the   ×   framework shown in fig    to guide our review of previous research on leadership in interteam contexts  in recent years  researchers have summarized studies of leadership processes targeted within teams in support of team objectives   in multiple well executed reviews of team leadership   and specific leadership theories    therefore  we focused our review on studies falling within one or more of the other three categories shown in fig      the starting point for our literature search was    corresponding with the appearance of articles calling for researchers to take an  ex  ternal  perspective to better understand the performance of teams    to identify articles  we conducted a search across a variety of relevant online databases   for articles published between january   and august    we used this approach in order to ensure that we identified articles from a range of academic disciplines  we required that articles contain one or more of the following search terms in the abstract  inter group or intergroup  inter team or interteam  boundary spanning or boundary activity   multi team or multiteam  and between team   additionally  we manually searched the reference sections of key publications   on the topics of teams  multiteam systems  boundary spanning  and intergroup relations in order to identify additional articles  we limited the results of our search to peer reviewed academic journals published in english  our initial search yielded   articles   in the next step  we removed duplicate articles and conducted a pre  screening process of the articles  titles and abstracts using the following inclusion criteria    the research appeared to be an empirical study      the research in  vestigated how leaders     manage or engage in interaction processes across group boundaries      affect intergroup relations  and or   facilitate superordinate   outcomes  and or the research investigated processes or psychological states that could be targets of cross boundary leadership for team goals   or leadership in support of system goals      the research was conducted within a workplace context or a la  boratory simulation of a workplace context    the research focused on variables at the individual   team   and or system level of analysis    and   the publication outlet s impact factor was equal to or higher than        we chose this impact factor as an inclusion criterion to ensure that our review drew on studies that are generally representative of research in the field and met standardized criteria for research quality  additionally  we excluded articles that did not consider out  comes at collective levels of analysis    further  as the focus of this review is on cross boundary leadership in the context of work teams  we followed the precedent of hogg et al    and did not consider studies examining leadership across other demographic or social identity boundaries  this pre screening process resulted in   articles of which   full texts were retrievable   during the pre screening process  we chose to err on the side of inclusion    in the final step of our process  the full text of each article was reviewed carefully by the authorship team to confirm its relevance to this review based on the inclusion criteria described previously  this vetting process resulted in a smaller subset of   articles  table   provides a list of the journals and the numbers of articles within each  where

explicitly  they high  lighted intrateam or interteam processes  states  or other attributes that are potential targets of leadership in interteam contexts   article coding  the first four authors extracted and coded each of the   articles to identify the ways in which each article addressed the core elements of functional leadership in interteam contexts    we coded the answers to these five questions into emergent sets of categories    as a quality check  every article was reviewed by at least two authors  and any in  consistencies were discussed until consensus was reached  we also identified characteristics of the research designs used in each study  as table   summarizes  the majority of articles presented quantitative research    among these was a predominance of quantitative field studies    which were predominantly cross sectional   using samples of working adults    studies of leadership   for team goals were more likely to use quantitative   rather than qualitative methods    studies of leadership for system goals were more evenly split between quantitative   and qualita  tive methods    we were encouraged to see studies using experi  mental designs   and mixed method approaches    additionally  many studies in  corporated best practices for addressing common method bias in  cluding crisscross designs  temporal separation  and or multi source data     synthesis of research on leadership in interteam contexts  our review revealed that most empirical studies have answered the question of  why  leadership is enacted    by emphasizing one of two levels of collective objectives    leadership supports team level objectives  or   leadership supports system level objectives  with only a small subset of studies emphasizing both team  and system level objectives simultaneously  we used the questions of  why  and  where  leadership occurs   in interteam contexts to organize and synthesize findings from prior research    in the following sections  we clarify how the extant literature has addressed the remaining three questions needed to un  derstand  functional  leadership in interteam contexts   for each category   category    internally focused

           solely on leadership targeted within teams in support of team objectives   is beyond the scope of this review  we summarize and draw from category   research in order to make comparisons between the ways in which researchers have addressed questions of  what    when   and  who  in category   versus the other categories   what  identifying leadership processes targeted within groups has been a primary focus of leadership research for nearly a century  these studies typically leverage a functional perspective  arguing that team leadership is  effective  if it ensures that all functions critical to task accomplishment and team maintenance are addressed     early influential studies organized leadership behaviors within groups into two broad categories  task oriented behaviors such as plan  ning  defining and clarifying objectives  problem solving  and mon  itoring goal progress  and person oriented behaviors such as showing concern for followers and expressing confidence in followers  abilities     additionally  with the rise of theories such as charismatic leadership    researchers began to emphasize change oriented leadership behaviors    which are aimed at spurring and or inspiring change within organizations   the core idea that effective leadership within groups involves task   person   and change oriented behaviors has continued to pervade more recent theories of leadership  such as transformational transactional leadership theory    servant leadership theory    and relational theories  including lmx    for example  person  and change or  iented behaviors are central to a transformational leadership style    servant leaders are thought to engage in both person oriented behaviors   and task oriented behaviors      team goals without

guided by a deep understanding of the or  ganization s mission    graen   uhl bien    argue that leaders should nurture high quality lmx relationships with followers characterized by trust  liking  and respect and offer followers opportunities to develop through task related roles and responsibilities  moreover  less effective leadership styles  such as laissez faire leadership   or abusive supervision   are often depicted as the absence and or opposite of task   person   and or change oriented leadership behaviors     within teams  research suggests that task oriented leadership be  haviors can initiate structure for the team by   clarifying team task requirements  establishing reward contingencies  specifying procedures  and providing feedback on task progress  both task  and person oriented leadership can help team members work effectively by facilitating the interpersonal interactions  cognitive architectures  feelings  and attitudes associated with effective teamwork    research on teams has also emphasized the importance of change oriented leader behaviors that support team innovation  crea  tive performance    and processes of collective transformation and learning    for instance  leaders who leverage after action reviews    establish a psychologically safe team cli  mate    and or facilitate a shared understanding of the task and team environment    can help teams better recognize and learn from prior mistakes and prepare for future challenges     indeed  meta analytic evidence has demonstrated that task   person   and change oriented leadership processes are positively asso  ciated with a variety of organizational outcomes  including group performance    derue et al    showed that initiating structure   represented the strongest predictor of group performance whereas change oriented behaviors   and person oriented behaviors   accounted for sizeable but lesser portions of the total variance   when  like many other areas of organizational scholarship   as research on lea  dership within teams has matured  many leadership scholars have moved beyond simple categorization schemas of  what leaders do    to specify critical boundary conditions or moderator variables that determine when leadership be  haviors and or relational processes within teams are more or less ef  fective  for instance  classic theories  including fiedler s   con  tingency theory and house s   path goal theory proposed a variety of situational factors both internal   as well as external to the team   that determine the effectiveness of leader  ship behaviors within groups  recent empirical studies in category   have echoed these core ideas by investigating a variety of internal moderators  including leader attributes    task de  mands    task interdependence    virtuality    and team diversity    and external moderators  such as environmental uncertainty    organizational norms    top management support    and national culture     researchers have also begun to emphasize the role of time as a key determinant of what constitutes  functional  leadership for teams  for example  kozlowski et al    conceptualized leadership as invol  ving dual roles that can operate simultaneously     a developmental role  linked to the process of team evolution  and   a task contingent  role that shifts its functional emphasis in response to the dynamics of team task cycles     whereas the developmental role involves a longer term process through which leaders help team members meld into a cohesive  culturally unique entity  the task contingent role is a more dynamic process which involves developing team goals  strate  gies  and expectations during phases of low intensity or routine task conditions  and intervening during higher intensity  stressful phases  morgeson et al    connected these ideas with marks  mathieu  and zaccaro    argument that teams cycle through repeating phases of  transition  and  action  to identify functional leadership behaviors corresponding to these two task phases  morgeson and colleagues argue that during transition phases  leadership should help compose the team  define the mission  establish expectations  structure and plan tasks  train and develop the team  and provide sensemaking and feedback  during action phases  leadership should monitor the team s progress toward goals  manage team boundaries  challenge the team  perform the team task  solve problems  provide resources  encourage team self  management  and support a positive social climate   who  lastly  the question of  who is leading     has be  come increasingly relevant as organizations have embraced flatter de  centralized and team based work structures   where informal leaders and leadership processes often operate alongside or in the absence of formal leaders    indeed  although most studies of team leadership have focused on the role  actions  and relationships of formal leaders    researchers often depict leadership as a dynamic and emergent social process of influence  which can occur up  down  and across the orga  nizational hierarchy    for example  a growing stream of research argues that there are benefits for teams who engage in shared forms of leadership    a dynamic  interactive influence process among individuals in groups for which the objective is to lead one another to the achievement of group or organizational goals or both     meta analyses have found that shared leadership is positively associated with teamwork processes and emergent psychological states  and accounts for unique variance in team performance beyond that accounted for by vertical   lea  dership     recently  several studies have suggested that identifying  who  is doing  what   when    holds the potential to advance the understanding of functional leadership within teams substantially    for example  morgeson et al    posited that team leadership   might originate from formal and or informal sources who reside inside or outside the team  further  they proposed that different sources of leadership might be better suited to fulfill different leadership functions depending on the phase   of team perfor  mance  for example  an external formal leader may be best positioned to compose and monitor the team  establish expectations and goals  manage team boundaries  provide resources  and encourage self man  agement  in contrast  internal informal leaders may be best suited to structure  plan  and perform the team task  solve problems  and support the social climate  some activities  like providing feedback can be ef  fectively fulfilled by all sources of leadership  although these proposi  tions have yet to be fully tested  they suggest many interesting lines of inquiry for future research   category    cross boundary leadership for the team  we identified   articles investigating cross boundary leadership processes enacted in support of team objectives    a subset of these articles discussed leaders  managers  and or leadership pro  cesses explicitly    these studies convincingly  d r  carter  et al  the leadership quarterly             demonstrate that   leaders often play an active role in managing interaction processes and relationships with external entities  however  the majority of articles   did not invoke the notion of leadership explicitly  but rather  identified cross boundary interaction processes  states  and or interventions that could be targets of leadership in in  terteam contexts    in combination  category   studies help clarify what cross boundary leadership pro  cesses are relevant to team outcomes  point to important boundary conditions for cross boundary leadership    and begin to identify the ways in which responsibility for cross boundary leadership might be distributed across different people     what  the literature on  boundary spanning  has provided sub  stantial insight into what  external  team activities might constitute cross boundary leadership processes and or might serve as targets of leadership in interteam contexts    in particular  ancona and caldwell s seminal program of research   identified several broad categories of external functions that link a group to its external environment  with the external environment referring to  actors or other teams residing within or outside of the boundary spanning team s host organization     scouting activities what marrone   refers to as  information search  include collecting information and resources from relevant outside parties  constructing a mental model of the external environment    and seeking feedback from members of other groups  ambassadorial activities   reflect attempts to  open up lines of communication with other groups    inform others about the team s pro  gress  negotiate and coordinate details of intergroup interactions    advocate for team needs    and influence or  mold  the external environment to suit the team s agenda  guarding or sentry ac  tivities involve managing   the flow of information and resources from the group to external entities and protecting the team s boundary by selectively allowing information to enter the team  lastly  task coordinator activities involve synchronizing work efforts with other teams and monitoring joint progress and strategy toward the accomplishment of shared goals   although researchers have referred to external team activities in different ways and have offered different categorization schemes    there is a clear consensus across prior research about the relevance of external activities for team outcomes    marrone      external activities can have direct effects on team outcomes by acting as conduits for information and resources that enable effective  ness and innovation    choi     marrone      for example  many studies have demonstrated positive relationships between external activities that support the acquisition of information  expertise  and resources with outcomes such as team creativity and innovation    external activities can also have indirect effects on team outcomes by impacting processes and psychological states within teams    for instance  henttonen  johanson    janhonen    found that team identity strength med  iates the relationships between both bonding   and bridging   social network ties and team performance  they argue that whereas bonding ties support team identity by enabling similar attitudes and perceptions   within teams  bridging ties support team identity by offering team members information about  outgroups  and thereby afford more elaborated intergroup social comparisons   notably  cross boundary processes are not always beneficial for all team outcomes  for example  ancona    distinguished different  types  of teams based on the degree to which they leveraged cross   boundary processes   informing  teams remained isolated until they were ready to inform outsiders of their progress   parading  teams em  phasized team building and achieving visibility while passively obser  ving other teams  and  probing  teams actively engaged outsiders  re  vised their knowledge through external contacts  initiated programs with outsiders  and promoted their teams  achievements within their organizations  although  probing  teams were rated as the highest performers  these teams also suffered short term decrements in member satisfaction and team cohesion  other studies have shown that cross  boundary processes can have negative implications for team perfor  mance  for instance  in a study of the communication networks of   interdisciplinary hospital teams  grippa et al     found that more effective teams were more inwardly focused and less connected to outside members as compared to less effective teams  similarly  a study of inter university project teams found that the degree to which team leaders and team members bridged structural holes   was negatively associated with team performance    indeed  pro  moting an external focus and encouraging team members to engage in cross boundary processes may deplete limited resources    distract attention from critical internal processes  and ultimately di  minish the cohesiveness of the team     in fact  there is growing consensus that there are trade offs inherent to cross boundary processes for teams  and thus  functional leadership involves helping teams strike an appropriate balance of internal and cross boundary interactions and team permeability  on the one hand  when team boundaries are highly permeable  team cohesiveness and coordination are likely to suffer  effective team functioning may depend on members differentiating themselves as a coherent unit  separate from the broader environment  by establishing a workspace  rules for operating  and goals specific to the team    actions by leaders that reinforce team boundaries and affirm teams  unique identities can decrease the like  lihood that members will experience identity threat when they interact with other teams    on the other hand  if team boundaries are not sufficiently permeable  teams can experience isola  tion and may not benefit from the knowledge and expertise of other teams  for instance  several studies we reviewed referenced the  not  invented here  syndrome    which refers to a ten  dency for teams who have had success in the past to become insular  believe they have a monopoly on the field  and thus  reject new ideas and influence from outside sources  the not invented here syndrome can be a major barrier to the inflow of new knowledge and thus  can stifle continued team learning and creative performance    therefore  leadership is needed to manage the permeability of team boundaries by both protecting and insulating teams from negative outside influences and additionally  by allowing resources and in  formation to flow both into and out of the team as required by team task demands     indeed  the extant literature emphasizes that leaders and leadership processes play a primary role in managing   external team activities  leaders can support their teams by assuming responsibility for external activities  in this case  the external activities constitute  external  or  cross boundary  leadership processes  for example  takanashi   lee    found that leaders of research and development   teams who engaged in boundary spanning behaviors were better able to mobilize external resources and enable their teams to achieve greater commercial success  the importance of leaders  participation in external activities is further supported by meta analytic evidence showing that higher performing teams tend to have leaders who are well connected in social networks  both internal and external to the team   and studies showing that projects led by formal leaders who actively engage in external project championing receive more support from the organization and are more successful    evidence  d r  carter  et al  the leadership quarterly             also suggests that leaders who have strong network ties can gather political support and scan for ideas  and team leaders with many structural holes in their networks   tend to be better able to protect their teams from outside interference     leadership processes can also help set up conditions within teams that facilitate connections between team members and outsiders  research shows that leaders influence the strategies teams use to in  teract with their environments  and in turn  differences in teams  stra  tegies help explain outcomes such as team performance and team member satisfaction    edmondson    showed that effective team leaders not only use their positional status to reach out to other high status individuals in the organization    they also encourage team members to engage in boundary  spanning behaviors themselves by signaling the desirability of an ex  ternal focus  research has also shown that empowering   and charismatic   leadership behaviors within teams are linked to team ex  ternal knowledge acquisition and the overall amount of team boundary  spanning behavior  respectively  similarly  cha  kim  lee    bachrach    showed that teams with transformational leaders had higher in  ternal teamwork quality and were perceived as more collaborative by members of other teams  suggesting cross boundary processes may be smoother for teams with transformational leaders   researchers have also identified a number of interventions leaders might use to increase teams  engagement in cross boundary processes  for example  chuang  jackson    jiang    examined the effect of human resource management   systems in a sample of r d teams  they find that when hrm systems support knowledge intensive teamwork  r d teams have higher levels of external knowledge ac  quisition and internal knowledge sharing  and these effects are stron  gest when knowledge is less tacit and in the absence of  empowering  leaders  foss   rodgers    showed that assigning managers to cross  unit initiatives was associated positively with their ability to use new information from other units  further  studies in category   have identified attributes at both individual  and team levels that might be targets of leadership influence  such as individuals  task experience    depth of functional expertise    and focus on goals with a  global impact     and teams  functional diversity    interdependence   and climate     when  with the awareness that cross boundary processes can have positive  negative  null  and or mixed effects on team outcomes  re  searchers are seeking to better understand the boundary conditions or moderators that determine when cross boundary interactions are most beneficial for teams  paralleling research on leadership within teams   studies in category   have suggested that aspects of both the internal team environment and the broader embedding environment can determine the effectiveness of cross boundary processes for teams  these studies are beginning to uncover how leaders might  strike the right balance  by capitalizing on the benefits of cross boundary pro  cesses for teams while mitigating the costs   with regard to the internal state of the team  some researchers have considered how team properties  such as team task demands  or the levels of task interdependence determine the necessity of cross  boundary interactions  for example  chung   jackson    found that the relationship between external work relationships on team perfor  mance depends on the routineness of the tasks that are performed  when teams performed higher novelty tasks  the density of both internal and external networks were predictive of team performance  whereas per  formance on highly routine tasks did not benefit from dense external network connections   the internal psychological state of the team can also determine the effectiveness of cross boundary processes  for instance  psychological  properties associated with the  not invented here  syndrome can reduce the effectiveness of cross boundary processes by leading teams to dis  count the influence and ideas offered by outsiders  in support of this argument  carbonell   rodríguez escudero    found the level of team cohesion moderated the effect of boundary spanning such that boundary spanning was less beneficial for highly cohesive teams  likewise  dokko  kane    tortoriello    showed that r d teams with strong team identification are less able to recombine knowledge from the external environment and generate creative ideas  in contrast  strong identification with an overarching superordinate group   enhanced team creative generativity  suggesting that the re  lationship between internal team psychological states and the benefits of cross boundary processes is complex and non linear  bullinger  neyer  rass    moeslein    showed that in a competitive environ  ment  teams with either very high or very low orientations toward co  operation with other teams   were most innovative   in contrast to category    very few category   studies have con  sidered how the timing of cross boundary processes might impact their utility  ancona   caldwell    found that ambassadorial activities appeared to be most relevant during the creation and diffusion phases of a team project  they suggest that a strategy that works early in the life of a group may not support positive performance over time  yet  the vast majority of studies we reviewed did not consider the types of temporal elements   that have been the focus of recent leadership within teams     the nature of a team s external environment can also shape the ef  fectiveness of cross boundary processes for teams  for example  faraj   yan    found that under organizational conditions of high resource scarcity and task uncertainty  teams engaged in increased boundary activities such as spanning  buffering  and reinforcing in order to secure resources and develop psychological safety among team mem  bers  in another socio structural study  gleibs   haslam    found that team members  willingness to support a leader s strategy for in  tergroup relations was dependent upon the current social context    and the team s status  when social relations were unstable  low status groups were more likely to support competitive leaders  but high status groups were more likely to support cooperative leaders  their findings underscore that leader effectiveness is con  tingent upon the social environment surrounding the team  as this alters how leaders are perceived internally   who  an equally important factor influencing the effectiveness of cross boundary leadership may be who is assuming   re  sponsibility for cross boundary leadership  empirical research supports the active role that formal leaders play in cross boundary leadership by directly engaging in cross boundary activities on behalf of their team    for example  ancona   caldwell    found that leaders en  gaged more frequently in ambassadorial  scouting  coordinating  and guarding activities than other members of the team  further  hirst   mann    showed that boundary spanning behaviors performed by formal leaders had a stronger relationship with team performance than boundary spanning behaviors performed by team members   however  a number of other studies have suggested benefits of distributing responsibility for boundary spanning across multiple members of the team    marrone  tesluk    carson    demonstrated that teams are more effective when more team members are engaged in boundary spanning  the authors posit that the presence of multiple boundary spanners may reduce the demands placed on individual team members  increase the amount of resources brought into the team  re  duce task uncertainty  and improve team member mental models re  garding the external environment  likewise  ferguson   blackman    found that boundary spanning was related to team cohesion and performance in top management teams and this relationship was  d r  carter  et al  the leadership quarterly             magnified as an increasing number of team members aside from the ceo participated in boundary spanning activities  currently  how  ever  both the extent to which formal versus informal leaders should engage in cross boundary leadership and the extent to which  boundary spanning  behaviors reflect the phenomenon of  leadership  remain poorly understood   the effectiveness of teams  external activities may also depend on the specific patterns of relationships that leaders   have with people in the external environment    for example  büchel  nieminen  armbruster domeyer    denison    found that new product devel  opment teams were most innovative when team members had trusting relationships with external  project champions   and broad   knowledge relationships  oh  chung    labianca    advanced the concept of group social capital in order to explain the importance of patterns of cross boundary connections for team perfor  mance  their results suggest that groups were most effective when group members had a moderate level of internal informal socializing relationships and a large number of ties to the leaders of other teams  continuing this line of inquiry may prove invaluable to understanding the patterns of cross boundary leadership relationships that promote team functioning   categories   and    iinternally focused and cross boundary leadership for the system  in contrast to most studies within category    studies of leadership in support of system goals rarely investigated and or theorized about leadership   processes targeted within teams   without also considering how these processes impact cross  boundary processes or states    therefore  reflecting the literature  we present findings from categories   and   within a single section  we identified   articles that emphasized the achievement of superordinate system level objectives requiring interdependent interac  tions across multiple teams  thirty of these articles   discussed leaders or leadership processes explicitly  and a small subset   evaluated both team  and system level objectives simulta  neously  scholars have long recognized the importance of collaboration across multiple groups   for organiza  tional success    however  the majority   of the studies we identified that focused on system level objectives were published during the last decade  suggesting an increasing interest in the drivers and outcomes of interteam collaboration in interdependent systems   what  three separate  but conceptually related  areas of research have emerged over the past two decades which clarify what leaders and leadership processes need to accomplish in order to support super  ordinate goals  the first two areas  which we refer to as  intergroup leadership  research   and  boundary spanning leadership  research    respectively  have origins within social psy  chological theories of intergroup relations    these two domains focus explicitly on leaders and lea  dership processes in intergroup contexts and highlight the psycholo  gical challenges leaders are likely to face when leading multiple dif  ferentiated groups    the third area   multiteam system functioning     has its origins within industrial organizational psychology and organizational behavior and draws heavily from theories of team functioning   and organizational design    although leadership is not always the primary focus of multi  team system research  most multiteam system studies explicitly or im  plicitly investigate leadership   as a factor contributing to system functioning   studies of intergroup leadership  boundary spanning leadership  and multiteam systems all have in common an emphasis on conveying the difficulties associated with facilitating collaboration in inter  dependent systems comprised of multiple groups or teams  it is not uncommon for teams to succeed individually but fail collectively as a system due to critical misalignment and collaboration problems be  tween teams    indeed  numerous studies began by highlighting interteam collabora  tion challenges  one recurring theme reflects the challenges associated with collaboration across teams with very different characteristics    for example  alter    found that functional differentiation between teams in an interorganizational service delivery context created conflict and inhibited coordination  likewise  gerber et al     illustrated how clinical research systems struggled to co  ordinate due to a lack of collective identity  low cohesion  and differing goals between teams which ultimately bred competition  similarly  in a study of university firm r d teams  takanashi   lee     found that teams struggled to overcome differences in culture  goals  and values  resulting in tensions that constructed barriers to collaboration   many studies also highlighted collaboration difficulties associated with change either within the system or external to the system  for example  in a study of multi agency emergency management systems  curnin  owen    trist    described how dynamics inherent to the operating environment placed demands on teams to share information and make decisions quickly  hindering collaboration  problems asso  ciated with dynamism have also been observed during crisis response as emergency medical services and emergency department teams must coordinate their efforts in a rapidly changing environment  accord  ingly  reddy et al     highlight how environmental dynamism in emergency response can make it difficult for geographically distributed teams to provide context during their between team communications  negatively impacting system wide collaboration  likewise  taneva  grote  easty    plattner     found that one of the most common causes of breakdowns in perioperative patient care was interteam co  ordination failures stemming from rapidly changing environments   luciano et al    theorize that the reason why differences be  tween teams and excessive dynamism   make interteam collaboration challenging is that these forces enhance the boundaries between teams and cause disruptions for system functioning  in turn  strong team boundaries and system dis  ruptions can lead constituent members to orient their interactions to  ward fellow teammates and away from members of other teams  thus limiting the development of the interteam behavioral processes   and affective motivational and cognitive psychological states   needed to achieve shared goals  however  as luciano et al  emphasize   this is not to suggest that low differentiation is the solution     the dif  ferences between teams and the dynamic nature of complex environ  ments are often the very reason multiteam systems are established in the first place  thus  leadership and other boundary related coordina  tion mechanisms   are needed in order to manage behavioral processes and psychological states within and across teams  echoing luciano and colleagues  argument that dif  ferences between teams should not be minimized  but instead  should be encouraged  lanaj  foulk    hollenbeck    found that multiteam systems perform most effectively when lower level component teams hold different preferences for risk taking from their formal leadership teams  when component teams are allowed to hold and express dif  ferences in opinion from formal leaders the system may be more likely to learn and evaluate ideas during interteam communication and less likely to fall prey to  groupthink      interteam states and processes as targets of leadership  paralleling re  search on leadership within teams in support of team objectives   many of the studies we reviewed in categories   and   highlighted behavioral processes and psychological states within  and  d r  carter  et al  the leadership quarterly             especially across  component team boundaries as key targets of lea  dership influence  for example  a few articles explored how  boundary spanning  activities  defined broadly  are relevant to system objectives  floyd   wooldridge    found that middle managers  boundary spanning was related to their own strategic influence as well as the performance of the system as a whole  glaser  fourné    elfring    highlight how overlapping boundary spanning ties between middle managers and top management team members facilitates innovation across a multi group business unit  further  in a study of innovation in science and technology parks  corsaro  ramos  henneberg    naudé    illustrate how boundary spanning drives resource transfer in in  terorganizational collaboration  supporting innovation   several studies emphasized the importance of interteam commu  nication quality and quantity to system performance  for instance  arnett   wittmann    found that communication quality was po  sitively associated with knowledge exchange between groups  kratzer  gemünden    lettl    examined the quantity of informal commu  nication between teams  interestingly  they found that there was an inverted u shaped relationship between informal interteam commu  nication and the creativity of multi team r d projects  the authors posit that although frequent interteam communication may lead to improved transfer of information  extremely high levels of interteam communication may prove to be a distraction  reducing individual autonomy and creativity  as well as overall efficiency   however  the majority of studies in categories   and   depict in  terteam coordination   as the most critical behavioral process associated with system outcomes  particularly within research on multiteam systems  moreover  research on multi  team systems emphasizes that leaders and leadership processes play a primary role in facilitating interteam coordination  the majority of studies of leadership in multiteam system contexts have investigated leadership originating from a formal leadership team   that is situated hierarchically above other component teams   for example  dechurch   marks    experimental study showed that training formal leadership teams on how to develop strategy as well as monitor and communicate information related to the multiteam task across teams fostered interteam coordination and system perfor  mance  using the same simulation  murase  carter  dechurch    marks     demonstrated that the development of system wide shared mental models about interteam coordination is a key mechanism linking leadership teams  communication about strategy to interteam coordination and performance  bick  spohrer  hoda  scheerer    heinzl    also discuss the importance of shared mental models in multiteam contexts  the authors found that team processes such as planning led to mental model convergence and a lack of similar mental models prohibited effective coordination between teams  findings from firth  hollenbeck  miles  ilgen    barnes    also emphasize the importance of shared mental models across teams  their work showed that frame of reference training   benefited within team coordination  between team co  ordination and multiteam system performance   formal leadership teams   are thought to be particularly critical in multiteam system contexts given the large size and complex processing demands of these systems    in  deed  davison and colleagues demonstrated that unbridled coordina  tion through mutual adjustment   between lower level component teams was negatively associated with system performance  however  mutual adjustment processes between formal boundary spanners and leadership team members benefited system performance  similarly  a study by de vries  hollenbeck  davison  walter    van der vegt    demonstrated that intrapersonal functional diversity   facilitates horizontal coordina  tion but inhibits aspirational behavior  however  this effect is moder  ated by vertical coordination  such that the negative effects of in  trapersonal functional diversity are not realized in the presence of vertical coordination between component teams and the formal lea  dership team  lanaj  hollenbeck  ilgen  barnes    harmon    also found that decentralized planning structures   had some benefit for system performance at  tributable to enhanced proactivity and aspiration levels  but also re  sulted in an overall negative effect attributable to risk taking and co  ordination failures   in addition to behavioral processes and shared cognitions  many of the studies we reviewed emphasized the need for leadership processes to relieve affective and or motivational barriers associated with inter  team collaboration  for example  intergroup leadership theory   suggests that leaders need to be mindful of the anxieties group members may experience when working with other groups and emphasizes that intergroup collaboration can threaten the distinctiveness of group identities and or lead group members to feel that the value of their own group s identity is diminished    pittinsky and simon proposed that leaders may improve intergroup relations by encouraging contact between members of dif  ferent groups  managing resources and interdependencies to reduce or prevent competition and conflict  promoting shared  superordinate identities  as well as  dual identities  to meet members  needs for dis  tinctiveness and belonging  and fostering positive intergroup attitudes   several studies provide support for this idea  richter  west  van dick    dawson    demonstrated that the relationship between group identity and effective intergroup relations was positive at high levels of system identification but not at low levels  likewise  gumusluoglu  karakitapoğlu aygün    scandura     found that benevolent leaders fostered team identification to the benefit of team innovative behavior  and simultaneously  fostered a cross team identity positively influencing interteam innovative behavior  cuijpers  uitdewilligen    guenter    further illustrated that system identity was more important for multiteam system processes and performance than team identity  similarly  porck et al     showed that organi  zational identification supported intergroup strategic consensus whereas team identification can overpower it  in contrast  porck et al     argued that superordinate identification develops feelings of un  certainty that deplete team members  cognitive resources  supporting their hypotheses they find   that team identification was positively associated with system performance  whereas system identification was negatively associated with system performance  moreover  these effects were stronger under conditions of high task complexity and weaker under conditions of low task complexity  these mixed results suggest there are both downsides as well as upsides to team and system identification and begs the question of what role leadership should play in helping to balance and  or alleviate the apparent tensions in order to ensure optimal team and system functioning   hogg et al    also questioned the benefits of creating a super  ordinate identity and proposed that intergroup leaders should instead help groups develop intergroup relational identities    they argue that intergroup relational identities can allow teams to maintain their distinctiveness  while also promoting effective colla  boration  empirical studies have not verified how leaders might facil  itate the development of intergroup relational identities  however  theoretical work suggests that leaders can promote these identities through their rhetoric           interactions   by modeling positive intergroup relations through their own cross boundary processes  and by facilitating interactions among members of different teams    by forming positive interpersonal relationships with members of each group  a leader may role model desired intergroup relations and foster intergroup trust  however  leaders also need to be aware of and manage group members  perceptions of their intergroup behaviors  on the one hand  leaders may be perceived as less effective within their own groups if they are seen as being overly supportive of another group s goals  identity  or status    on the other hand  a leader who exhibits an over emphasis on activities within teams can undermine the team s ability to collaborate effectively with others     similarly  ernst and chrobot mason s work on boundary spanning leadership   proposed that lea  ders can use a series of interrelated strategies to promote collaborative psychological relationships between groups  the first strategy   mana  ging boundaries   begins within teams and consists of two steps  buf  fering and reflecting  the goal of buffering is to protect a team from undue outside influences  affirm the team s identity  and promote a sense of safety and security among team members  teams then engage in reflecting by clarifying their own values  priorities  expertise  roles  and needs and prepare to share this information with members of other teams  ernst and chrobot mason argue that these internally focused leadership behaviors prepare teams to effectively engage with other entities within and beyond their organization as collaborative partners and help team members avoid identity threat  second  they propose that it is important to have members of different groups connect on a personal level   to foster interpersonal trust   in addition to   iden  tities  several studies have identified other affective and motivational constructs within and across teams that might be targets of leadership influence in support of superordinate goals  for example  emerging research highlights the impact of states such as anxiety and psycholo  gical safety on system effectiveness  park   deshon    for example  studied how the quality of group discussions influences competition  fear  and greed between groups  notably they find that groups who engaged in structured discussions were more likely to have high quality discussions  which in turn reduced greed and fear  and decreased the likelihood of competing with outsiders  in a study of ad hoc multiteam system aircrews  bienefeld   grote    found that psychological safety within teams mediated the effects of leader inclusiveness on team members  speaking up behavior within teams and boundary spanners  speaking up across team boundaries  interestingly  team boundary  spanners  perceptions of leader inclusiveness and psychological safety between teams had no effect on speaking up between teams  rather  it was the boundary spanners  perceptions of within team psychological safety that mattered most  fleştea  curşeu    fodor    also in  vestigated psychological safety  exploring the influence of power dis  parity  the authors find that high power disparity positively influences system performance by engaging team members in a higher level of information processing  but also has negative effects on performance as it stifles perceptions of psychological safety and fosters a negative af  fective climate   a subset of studies has explored the effects of motivational con  structs such as goals  priorities  and collective efficacy  in a study of a semiconductor plant  millikin  hom    manz    illustrated that systems comprised of highly cohesive component teams that engaged in self management   were the most productive  in a case study of the response to the space shuttle columbia disaster  beck   plowman    found that establishing  communicating  and monitoring shared superordinate goals was pivotal for the emergence of collaboration between teams  goal alignment both within and between teams appears to be another important motivational factor  for instance  meth   lawless    hawryluck    found that one of the greatest sources of conflict in intensive care units is the presence of incompatible and or inconsistent goals regarding patient care across the various healthcare teams that comprise the unit  ultimately resulting in reductions in quality of care  unfortunately  some research has shown that different teams are not necessarily aware of the fact that their goals are mis  aligned  for instance  power   alison    observed that different agencies in an emergency response system prioritized different goals    despite the observed goal con  flicts  however  participants believed that their interagency goals were aligned with one another    suggesting that members of different teams may be unaware of goal conflicts   when  studies in categories   and   suggest that many factors can act as boundary conditions determining the effectiveness of specific leadership processes within and across teams  these factors may ori  ginate within teams    across teams    and in the embedding environment     for instance  several studies have emphasized that the nature of interteam interdependence can play an influential role for various func  tions and outcomes both within and across teams  marks  dechurch  mathieu  panzer    alonso    showed that interteam processes were more critical at high levels of interteam interdependence than at lower levels where teams functioned under greater autonomy  in another study by glynn  kazanjian    drazin     team identification and team members  perceptions of interteam interdependence interacted to predict intentions to innovate such that individuals with high team identification and high interteam interdependence perceptions had lower intentions to innovate   recent work by kennedy  sommer    nguyen    utilized com  putational modeling and virtual experiments to investigate how leaders facilitate multiteam system communication across differing levels of team interdependence and project complexity  their results show that the level of interdependence between teams influences the frequency with which leaders must make changes to communication plans in re  sponse to changing project complexity  specifically  whereas systems with low to moderate interteam interdependence may rely on similar paths of communication for tasks of varying complexity    multiteam systems with high interteam interdependence must adapt their mix of communication tools depending on task complexity to prevent communication channels from becoming overburdened   a number of studies in categories   and   have also begun to ex  plore how leadership processes need to shift depending on the timing or phase of task performance  for example  dechurch   marks    evaluated leadership teams  use of strategizing behaviors during tran  sition phases    and coordination behaviors during action phases    other research has examined the critical role of leader planning during transition phases   and the importance of effective team boundary management  especially in the early conceptual phases of a collaborative project to prevent teams from falling behind schedule     further  park   deshon    found that discussion leaders who advocate for cooperation between teams are better able to influence team members early in the formation of a group when members are receptive to normative power  however  over time  high quality in  ternal discussions were more important for decreasing team members  feelings of greed and fear  and therefore their desire to compete with outsiders  in another recent study quiroz  brunson    bigras    present an in depth case study of the dynamic processes of mutual adjustment that occurred between two professional teams participating  d r  carter  et al  the leadership quarterly             in a multicomponent community based intervention    during the initial stages of collaboration  mutual adjustment involved division of roles and responsibilities based on areas of expertise  withdrawal from partner s area of expertise  and a relative paucity of direct interaction between groups  interestingly  after a shock to the system  these rules transformed  rather than dividing work based on expertise  the teams worked together directly to find a solution  new links were created to enhance intergroup communication  and groups came to function with a coherent joint approach to intervention  in combination  these studies exemplify the growing acknowledgement that the timing of leadership is a critical determinant of leadership effectiveness   who  a few studies have begun to illustrate the potential im  portance of informal leadership influence processes in the context of superordinate goals  for example  kratzer  gemünden    lettl    study of multi team r d projects found that there are benefits to a moderate overlap in formal and informal communication structures  a case study of subsea operations in the oil industry  found that when formal leaders were inaccessible  individual team members would re  spond by performing leadership functions without explicit delegation by the formal leader    whereas another a case study found that formal and informal leader  ship structures were put in place both within and between teams to ensure the success of school reform in complex environments  which require cross sector collaboration and leadership structures that leverage the expertise of the functional groups    these studies illustrate the often complementary relationship between formal and informal leadership   however  informal leadership processes are not always effective in the context of system goals  for instance  supporting the implementa  tion of a formal leadership team    ingvaldsen   rolfsen    examined how shared leadership and rotating group spokespersons can be used as al  ternatives to hierarchical control in autonomous work groups using a qualitative case study of a manufacturing firm  they found that the two alternatives tend to under perform as they weakened the system s ability to regulate non routine situations and evaluate integral pro  cesses  their findings underscore the need for further research clar  ifying why informal leadership emerges  as in some circumstances in  formal leadership may prove to be detrimental  another example comes from newell   swan     who conducted a case study of a multi  disciplinary research system  they argued that high levels of trust were necessary to facilitate the levels of communication needed to generate scientific innovation  however  the system experienced a severe dis  trust  power struggles  a lack of accountability across sites  and a high level of ambiguity for lower level group members  these findings sug  gest that even in the presence of formal authority structures  power struggles and informal influence processes might disrupt system func  tioning   three recommendations for advancing integrative research on leadership in interteam contexts  our review demonstrates that leadership scholars are increasingly answering calls   to adopt an external perspective by examining how team members and leaders reach beyond team boundaries to support team outcomes   and coordinate with other teams as part of interdependent systems    re  searchers have made great strides in terms of clarifying what interac  tion processes  states  and leadership behaviors comprise  functional  leadership in interteam contexts  as well as why and where leadership is enacted  however  our review also revealed that research is far from offering a complete picture of leadership in interteam contexts as stu  dies have progressed within separate siloed literatures that emphasize  leadership processes needed to support team or system objectives  but not both  further  our review identified critical limits to our current understanding of when certain leadership processes are most appro  priate and who   should assume responsibility for leadership  therefore  in the following  we build on these limitations to offer three overarching recommendations for future research that aims to move the field from collecting pieces of a jumbled puzzle to com  pleting a coherent picture of leadership in interdependent organiza  tional systems        clarify how leaders balance  what  across levels of  why  and  where   the studies we reviewed convincingly demonstrate that leadership processes within and across team boundaries are relevant to the achievement of both team  and system level collective goals  however  the extant literature hints at the idea that the leadership processes that support team goals might not always support system goals  or vice versa  for example  whereas the literature on boundary management emphasizes that leaders enable team success by securing external re  sources that support team objectives and by protecting the team from outside demands    choi      the literature on multiteam systems has argued that leadership processes need to ensure that all component teams in the system act in pursuit of shared superordinate goals  regardless of whether teams  win  in  dividually    ex  amining team or system success in isolation makes it challenging for researchers to provide practically relevant guidance for how leadership can support success across both collective levels  thus  our first re  commendation is for future research to integrate across research areas in order to better clarify how leaders balance the competing demands of interteam contexts  in order to do so  we propose four key advance  ments   first  and most obviously  we believe that it is imperative for studies of leadership in interdependent systems to measure and theorize about performance at multiple levels of observation  the failure of most stu  dies of cross boundary processes to examine both team and system outcomes in the same research study is especially problematic given arguments made repeatedly in studies falling within categories       and   that what is  good for the team  and what is  good for the system  may be at odds with each other  leaders at all levels in organizations have to navigate inherent tensions which result from multilevel goal hierarchies  multilayered goal and task interdependencies    and political and relational dynamics that knit together organizational systems  it is impossible to evaluate empirically how leaders balance these competing demands without evaluating outcomes at multiple collective levels   second  we identified many discrepancies across the different ca  tegories of research in terms of what leadership processes are empha  sized most often  we suggest that developing a comprehensive under  standing of how leaders balance the demands of interteam contexts may require more integration of the ideas about  what leaders do  in these siloed areas of research  for example  in category    researchers em  phasize the importance of task   person  and change oriented leadership behaviors for team performance    however  examining the behaviors discussed in categories       and    reveals an overwhelming emphasis on task or  iented behaviors    the lack of attention toward person  and change oriented behaviors is an important oversight as leveraging person oriented and change oriented leadership behaviors might be imperative in intergroup contexts characterized by competing priorities  for example  change oriented leadership behaviors   might allow the leader of one team to re  duce his or her own goal conflicts by shifting the goals others prioritize to better align with his or her own priorities  studies of leadership in the context of superordinate goals   may also benefit  d r  carter  et al  the leadership quarterly             from leveraging more of the nuances of  boundary management  ac  tivities identified in category    for example  although task coordina  tion is heavily emphasized in studies of multiteam systems  other in  terteam processes that have been shown to support team performance  such as the degree to which teams scout information  represent their work to others  and guard protect their borders   are largely ignored  again  skill in these more  politically or  iented  behaviors may be essential to leaders  abilities to navigate the tensions of interteam contexts   third  many studies in categories   and   suggest that certain cross  boundary processes might have non linear effects for team or system objectives  for example  the literature on boundary spanning empha  sizes that team leaders should help their teams strike an appropriate balance of team permeability    likewise  the literature on multiteam systems suggests that although coordination between teams through direct mutual adjustment is often necessary  inefficient patterns of interteam coordination that are not well matched to task demands can be harmful    these previous investigations which have uncovered non linear effects of  beneficial  team interteam phenomena point to a need for future research to continue this line of inquiry  particularly in light of mounting evidence that many phenomena exhibit a  too much of a good thing  effect    we also encourage research to identify specific recommendations for leaders about how to establish the  optimal  levels of team and interteam states and processes   finally  we emphasize that  as researchers  we cannot assume that it is clear which goals will take priority  leadership  in this review  has been functionally defined as meeting the needs of the team and or the system to enable goal fulfillment  however  this is the functional ideal  in reality it is less clear which  needs  leaders will focus on meeting  one specific pathway to understand how leaders may navigate tensions created by conflicting team team or team system goals is to consider leaders  accountability  accountability refers to the  perceived expectation that one s decisions or actions will be evaluated by a salient audience and that rewards or sanctions are believed to be contingent on this expected evaluation     notably  re  wards and sanctions do not need to be material in nature    but rather  can come in the form of im  plications for one s social reputation     we expect personal and professional dynamics in many workplaces to produce accountability structures that differ widely from what one might expect based on formal hierarchies or workflow processes  individuals  are driven to maintain good standing in the eyes of those they deem to be key constituents    thus  how individuals prioritize team and system goals may be governed by their perceived accountability to different actors or groups in the organization  for example  leaders may need to give an account of their actions to not only superiors  but also peers  and subordinates  relatedly  a key  role  of leadership may be to communicate what is important and to whom members are accountable  organizations might assume certain  pre  scribed  objectives are also  perceived   but that is not always the case  and leaders   can significantly impact local per  ceptions of what is important    despite being de  scribed as  the adhesive that binds social systems together     our review found that discussions of account  ability are absent from studies of leadership in interteam contexts        elaborate  what  in the context of  when   many of the studies we reviewed demonstrated the growing ma  turity of the leadership field by exploring critical boundary conditions of leadership processes which originate within teams  between teams  and or in the embedding environment  however  we also identified significant opportunities to advance knowledge about leadership in  interteam contexts by examining additional moderators particularly with regard to leadership processes spanning team boundaries  therefore  our second recommendation is to better elaborate  what  leaders do in the context of  when   we highlight a few examples below   first  like most areas of organizational research  there is an obvious need to better understand how leadership processes within and across teams play out across time  we found almost no research in category   investigating how the timing of cross boundary activities might impact team outcomes  in contrast  research on multiteam systems has begun to consider how interteam leadership processes might need to be mat  ched to the phase of system task performance    however  across all categories of our framework  we found a preponderance of short term and cross sectional studies    it is difficult to make firm recommendations for leaders based on short  term studies of leadership and collaboration given evidence suggesting teams and systems change in meaningful ways over time    in fact  in one of the few studies of cross  boundary processes across time  ancona   showed teams that use  probing  strategies suffered short term decrements in team satisfaction but performed the best in the long term   notably  cross sectional designs can also severely undermine the ability to assess causality and endogeneity concerns  briefly  endogeneity concerns exist when the effect of x on y cannot be interpreted because it includes omitted causes and results due to a variety of study design flaws  including omitted variables  omitted selection  simultaneity  common method variance  and measurement error    although it appears   that researchers often address one potential source of endogeneity    there are additional recommendations that can help address other sources  first  increased use of appropriate control variables  which antonakis et al    defined as  exogenous sources of variance that do not correlate with the error term     can help address omitted variable bias  second  increasing the use of experimental or quasi experimental designs could allow researchers to disentangle causal effects    further  none of the studies we reviewed utilized field experiments  field experiments have been used in other disciplines  including economics  for a considerable period of time    although the use of field experiments is less prevalent in the realm of leadership research    there are substantial benefits of using field experiments that could reduce potential concerns regarding causality and en  dogeneity and might be a fertile ground for testing theory central to leadership in intergroup contexts in a controlled and rigorous way   second  although qualitative studies of multiteam systems often emphasize that task demands and system memberships can shift dy  namically over time  quantitative studies  especially those conducted in laboratory settings  have tended to model multiteam systems with ex  tremely stable memberships and task demands that operate on rela  tively short   time frames  thus  we identified a need for quan  titative studies of interdependent systems to consider how leadership processes might support major changes in task demands and system memberships  important questions include  what leadership processes allow high functioning systems to remain so when power dynamics shift as teams that were more central to system task demands become less central  what leadership processes are most effective in dynamic in  terdependent systems where team membership is highly fluid     third  additional research is warranted that evaluates how the types of system tasks might determine the most effective patterns of leader  ship and teamwork processes  teams and systems tackle a variety of types of tasks ranging from more conceptual   to more  d r  carter  et al  the leadership quarterly             behavioral    however  whereas the qualitative   of multiteam systems we reviewed considered both highly conceptual   as well as highly behavioral   system demands  the majority of the quantitative empirical studies we reviewed focused exclusively on behavioral tasks    interestingly  an overarching conclusion from these studies ap  pears to be that a multiteam system will function best when team identification is strong  teams are rather insular  and interteam co  ordination processes are handled almost exclusively by a select set of boundary spanners and members of formal leadership teams  however  in the context of creativity tasks  studies from category   have sug  gested that when teams are overly insular and believe they have a monopoly on a particular domain  they may be unwilling to be influ  enced by the contributions offered by  outsiders  and consequently  may suffer creativity decrements    further  whereas studies of team boundary spanning have suggested that teams engage in more boundary activities during times of task uncertainty    theoretical work on multiteam systems suggests that team members may engage in less interteam interaction under situations of high task uncertainty    clearly more research is needed to disentangle these inconsistencies and provide more targeted recommendations for leaders   relatedly  we believe that exploring how leadership processes should be matched to the nature of interteam interdependence   is a promising avenue for future research  pairs of in  terdependent teams in organizational systems might be engaged in pooled    sequential  reciprocal  and or intensive forms of inter  dependence at certain points in time    these different forms of interteam interdependence may be used as a preliminary guide for structuring leadership processes between teams   and for helping leaders understand how to prioritize goals   when they face potential trade offs across levels of a multiteam goal hierarchy  that is  when teams are pursuing shared goals that require pooled forms of interdependence  they work separately  but may benefit from an awareness of what other teams are doing  under these circumstances  emphasizing team level goals is a top priority and external leadership processes   may be kept to a minimum  however  as pairs of teams move toward highly intensive forms of in  terdependence driven by superordinate goals  leadership processes may need to shift toward enhancing collaborative psychological states be  tween teams that support joint problem solving and integration of ideas without also losing sight of team level goal accomplishment  and may need to involve more   leaders  unfortunately  only a small subset of the studies we reviewed described the nature of interteam interdependencies in great detail  particularly within cate  gory    thus  in order to build an evidence base related to these pro  positions  we strongly suggest that future research specify the nature of the interteam interdependencies between pairs of teams when ex  amining team and leadership processes        evaluate  who  should   enact  what   where   quantitative studies of leadership within teams in support of team goals   are finding that informal leadership   is important and often  augments formal  leadership to improve team effectiveness    however  across the other three categories of research  we found a paucity of quantitative investigations of informal leadership  this is unfortunate because qualitative case studies across all three areas have often found that informal leadership processes do  in fact  exist in interteam contexts    and may not always support team or system objectives    therefore  our third re  commendation is for future research to more carefully evaluate the antecedents and outcomes of informal leadership influence in interteam contexts   for example  in the context of studies within category    researchers have depicted cross boundary processes as functions that formal leaders might enact and additionally  as functions that can be distributed among multiple team members    however  the studies we reviewed typically measured the overall  amount  of team boundary spanning without considering which team members are enacting those processes    the few exceptions to this trend suggest that there are meaningful effects when the patterning of team members  boundary spanning behavior is taken into account    given the complex  multifaceted nature of most modern workplaces  targeted  purposeful  and coordinated patterns of boundary spanning efforts are likely to yield more positive results than unstructured activities  left solely to chance  leadership in interteam contexts should work to ensure that the right people within the team are connecting with the right other people external to the team and that the cross boundary actions of team members are not unnecessarily duplicated or working at cross purposes  research is needed to provide more targeted guidance about how teams can best distribute responsi  bility for cross boundary processes to support collective goals   the vast majority of quantitative studies in categories   and   have investigated leadership influence after a formal leadership team has been established  there are certainly numerous benefits to having a formal leadership team that is devoted to achieving the shared super  ordinate goal of the system and is focused exclusively on managing all interteam coordination demands    unfortunately  not all systems contain a formal leadership team  at least not during the initial stages of system performance  moreover  even when formal leadership teams are es  tablished  there may be power dynamics at play and disagreements about which goals should be prioritized    indeed  lanaj  foulk    hollenbeck    findings that formal leadership teams and lower level component teams can hold   different preferences for risk taking hint at the possibility that  leadership  in  fluence can emanate from formal as well as informal sources   therefore  we strongly suggest that future research should seek to better understand why informal leadership influence processes arise within and across teams particularly in the context of interdependent teams whose joint efforts could be used to achieve important societal or organizational goals  doing so could help illuminate whether the pat  terns of leadership influence that are associated with high levels of system performance under certain circumstances are also the patterns that are likely to arise  moreover  should researchers find that the pat  terns of leadership that are likely to emerge are not the patterns of leadership that are most effective  understanding the antecedents of these social systems could help point toward organizational interven  tions   for example  the design of organizational structures and workflows as well as decisions regarding goals  reward systems  and personnel   are often not made with the explicit purpose of influencing how employees interact with each other   d r  carter  et al  the leadership quarterly             nevertheless  these decisions by formal leaders shape how networks of relationships   develop in the workplace    these decisions  fundamentally alter the internal social structure of organizations by fluctuating the pool of human capital    altering employee interaction patterns    and changing the nature of employee relationships       thus  formal leaders should include in their calculus how decisions regarding personnel assign  ments  work design  goals  and performance evaluations might shape the development of relationships among employees that impact the achievement of collective goals     notably  simply prescribing patterns of cross boundary activities needed to achieve team and system goals may not be sufficient and could even be detrimental    thus  we argue that leaders would be better served to focus on understanding how they can set up the  facilitating conditions    that support the emergence of beneficial networks of informal influence in interdependent systems   as opposed to attempting to prescribe formalized structures in their entirety  for in  stance  research suggests that actions of formal leaders  signal whether it is advisable for members of their team to form cross boundary re  lationships  leaders encourage cooperation or  conversely  competition with their rhetoric and the goals and structures they emphasize    for example  leaders who emphasize intra or  ganizational comparisons may improve performance for their team by increasing motivation  but this decision may also evoke feelings of rivalry with others   and lead to destructive competitive emotions   and behaviors     future research might also draw inspiration from the fields of eco  nomics    healthcare    and marketing   to learn how leaders might  nudge  employees toward making decisions that will help their team and the broader organizational system in which the team is em  bedded when developing  maintaining  and altering their workplace relationships  recently  tawse  patrick  and vera   proposed that nudges   might be used to encourage strategic leaders to shift their attention from plan  ning activities to the hard work of strategy implementation  they proposed that nudges may be used to create an implementation mindset by removing planning distractions and using verbal framing to strengthen managers  willpower  future research might focus on iden  tifying nudges that leaders might use to encourage desirable cross  boundary behaviors  although the aim is not to  prescribe  the devel  opment of specific relationships  formal leaders still need to have a clear picture of what types and patterns of cross boundary connections are needed in order to achieve collective goals across levels so that they might create conditions that encourage employees to form these re  lationships themselves   conclusion  enacting leadership in interteam contexts is often a balancing act and a moving target and so is the study of leadership in interteam contexts  we applaud previous researchers who have taken on the im  mensely complex challenge of delineating the nature of  functional  leadership in interteam contexts  we hope this review serves as a foundation for future research that connects ideas and perspectives  across disparate areas of inquiry in order to further clarify how formal and informal leaders and leadership processes within and across teams support organizational objectives across team and system levels   references  aime  f   humphrey  s   derue  d  s     paul  j  b

r a c t  a growing body of literature has focused on transgressions in the workplace and more recently  with respect to leader follower relationships  despite the important implications of leader and follower transgressions and re  lationship repair for work outcomes  there has not been a systematic review that examines the broad spectrum of leader and follower transgressions and most importantly adopts a dynamic relational process perspective  we view transgressions as key events in leader follower relationships that trigger re evaluation of the relationship  relationship repair processes and influence work outcomes  the purpose of this review is threefold  first  to provide a state of the science review of the growing literature  second  to offer a critical analysis of leader and follower transgressions in terms of conceptualization  methodological issues and theoretical underpinnings  third  to outline a research agenda addressing leader follower transgressions  relationship repair processes and outcomes based on relationship science   introduction  relationship fractures and transgressions in the workplace have received considerable attention in organizational research    transgression events threaten workplace relationships and may cause irreparable damage and dis  solution  a focal work relationship is that between a leader and a fol  lower and transgression events in this context can potentially have serious implications for work related outcomes such as well being  engagement  performance  and retention     prior integrative research on workplace transgressions has focused on work relationships in general   and has offered important insights on relational processes such as relationship resilience and trust repair    however  there has been limited emphasis on the leader follower dyad and the specific implications of leader follower transgressions  the implicit assumption underlying previous general reviews is that leader follower relations are similar to other relation  ships in organizational contexts and that any general insights can also  be applied to the leadership domain  given the abundance of studies focusing on relationship based leadership perspectives    with leader member exchange   being the second most prolific research area in the leadership domain    such an assumption downplays the complexity of leader follower relationships  we argue that leader follower transgres  sions warrant special attention as there are some fundamental differ  ences between leader follower relationships and other workplace re  lationships which we describe below   the leader follower relationship is characterized by power asym  metries due to hierarchical status differences that can influence the outcomes of the transgression and the relationship repair strategies employed  prior research on forgiveness has shown that the more powerful the partner  the less likely it is for him her to forgive   and the more likely it is for him her to seek revenge    also  leader follower relationships are characterized by high levels of interdependence    the follower depends upon the leader for a wide range of resources   but also the leader depends upon the follower for resources such    received   november    received in revised form   december    accepted   december    ⁎ corresponding author  e mail

such high interdependence has important implications for relationship main  tenance acts following a transgression   we are only aware of one major review that has focused on leader transgressions   and no reviews that address follower transgressions or  importantly  emphasize both lea  dership and followership perspectives  krylova et al    provided a very good review of integrity based transgressions and adopted mainly a leader centric view of transgressions  they specifically reviewed the literature on leader s integrity based wrongdoing and subsequent da  mage to followers  trust and moral identity  in doing so  they synthe  sized existing research on integrity based wrongdoing with the ex  perimental philosophy literature on moral cognition    the aim of our review is to focus on a broad spectrum of transgressions and adopt a relational lens in order to cast light on both leader and follower transgressions  relationship repair strategies and work related outcomes   we aim to make three key contributions  first  we critically review existing definitions and typologies  discuss theoretical underpinnings  address methodological issues and offer suggestions for increased de  finitional clarity and methodological advancement  second  we provide a state of the science review of the growing literature  we review ex  isting research on both leader and follower transgressions  relationship repair processes and outcomes  identify points of convergence and gaps in the literature  third  we outline a future research agenda by offering an integrative process model of leader follower transgressions  re  lationship repair strategies  boundary conditions and outcomes based on insights from the multidisciplinary literature on relationship science  we try to uncover the nuances of the phenomenon of transgressions  its dynamic and events based nature and its implications for individual  dyadic and group outcomes in organizational settings  we believe that our review is timely and can significantly extend our understanding of what happens when things go wrong in leader follower relationships as well as how   the relationship can be re  paired   conceptualization of leader and follower transgressions  definitions and typologies  interpersonal transgressions have been generally defined as    actions taken by others against a person that go beyond the limits of normative social intercourse and  therefore  violate various social and moral codes     in the broad workplace relationships literature  in addition to  transgressions     we find similar terms such as  betrayals      offenses    and  trust violations    to denote actions that cause harm to a potential victim   at work   leader transgressions have been defined similarly to interpersonal transgressions as  leaders  actions  at work  whose appropriateness is questionable when judged by norms associated with workplace related policies  procedures  or practices and or with codes of interpersonal conduct     basford   further focused on supervisor transgressions at work and defined them as      super  visor s actions in the workplace that are perceived to violate work norms  including those relating to policies  procedures  practices  or interpersonal conduct     basford argued that examining super  visor transgressions versus general leader transgressions is relevant due to the unique nature of the supervisor subordinate relationship  in his view  employees will experience different interactions with leaders at various hierarchical levels   and thus the im  plications of supervisory   transgressions will not  be the same as ceo or senior leaders  transgressions  basford thus in  directly acknowledged the complex and multi level nature of leader transgressions  but this is not reflected either in his definition or ty  pology of transgressions  to the best of our knowledge  there does not exist a separate definition of follower transgressions   when it comes to specific transgression typologies  one of the ear  liest categorizations of workplace transgressions    is that by bies and tripp    namely  they suggested that workplace offenses can be categorized as    goal obstruction      violation of rules  norms and promises    and   status and power derogation    in the trust lit  erature  there is a well established distinction between competence  and integrity based trust violations or transgressions    competence based transgressions involve unin  tentionally harming the followers due to the lack of knowledge  skills or resources   whereas integrity based transgressions entail intentionally offending or inconveniencing followers because of self  ishness  dishonesty or discrimination     in the leadership literature  shapiro et al    offered a typology of eight leader transgressions    absenteeism negligence of duty      verbal physical abusiveness      dis  crimination      favoritism      dishonesty      incompetence      inter  personal sabotage    and   miscellaneous  shapiro et al    further identified that more than half of the leader  transgressors were just one or two hierarchical levels above the parti  cipants and the most frequent type was dishonesty related transgres  sions   other typologies include the one by basford   who identified eleven supervisory transgression types and further classified them on a spectrum ranging from active to passive  active transgressions were considered those that the supervisor commits by intentionally behaving in a certain way  such as performance criticisms and demeaning insults  on the other side of the spectrum  passive supervisor transgressions are those that arise from the lack of supervisor action  effort  or behavior  such as undersupplied resources  and underprovided recognition  grover  hasel  manville  and serrano archimi   also classified transgressions into two types  recoverable and unrecoverable  they gen  erally classified competence based transgressions as recoverable and integrity based transgressions as unrecoverable but further highlighted the importance of acknowledging factors and conditions that allow for recovery such as intentionality   in the leadership literature  there are no specific typologies of fol  lower transgressions  but we can borrow insights from the literature on workplace deviance and counterproductive work behaviors  robinson and bennett   defined employee deviance as    voluntary be  havior that violates significant organizational norms and in so doing threatens the well being of an organization  its members  or both    and identified four types of deviance  two organization focused  i e   production deviance    property deviance   and two interpersonal co worker focused  i e   political deviance   and personal aggression    gruys and sackett   have also offered a taxonomy of eleven counterproductive work behaviors    theft and related behavior    destruction of property    misuse of  o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             information    misuse of time and resources    unsafe behavior    poor attendance    poor quality work    alcohol use    drug use    inappropriate verbal actions  and   inappropriate physical actions  it is important to note that the above typologies are not directly focused on the leader follower relationship  the transgression target is either the organization in general   or the co workers   and there is no explicit acknowl  edgement that these are examples of deviance in leader follower in  teractions  however  subsequent empirical studies have explicitly linked leadership with employee deviance behaviors    for ex  ample  mitchell and ambrose   added supervisor directed de  viance to bennett and robinson s   model and adapted their in  terpersonal deviance items to indicate behaviors targeted against the supervisor    other studies   argued that leaders serve as representatives for their organization and thus follower organizational deviance can be viewed as leader targeted  based on this literature  we argue that employee deviance typologies can offer some general insights on the possible content of follower transgressions   we summarize all the above typologies in table    as it becomes evident from table    when attempting to synthesize  these diverse typologies into a unified framework  three broad types of leader follower transgressions emerge    transgressions violating the existing task accomplishment and performance norms  such as in  competence  absenteeism and negligence of duty which we classify as task focused transgressions    transgressions violating norms of inter  personal interaction and hurting a person s self esteem  such as inter  personal sabotage and verbal abuse  labeled person focused transgres  sions  and   transgressions which violate moral and ethical norms such as dishonesty and discrimination  labeled ethics focused transgressions   table   offers a comparison of existing typologies under this tri  partite framework of task   person  and ethics focused transgressions  as we can see in table    there are inevitably overlaps and re  dundancies among typologies  for example  basford s   category of inequitable behavior encompasses shapiro et al  s   dis  crimination and favoritism themes  shapiro et al  s   absenteeism  negligence of duty category encompasses aspects of basford s    undersupplied resources  since employees in both categories are not provided with sufficient support  furthermore  basford s   false accusations contain elements of shapiro et al  s dishonesty and inter  personal sabotage themes  as well as the categories of recognition and unfair employment decisions  one difference between shapiro et al  s   categories of leader transgressions and basford s   cate  gories of supervisor transgressions is that the category of leader in  competence did not arise as a common theme in basford s study  basford   suggested that this discrepancy arose due to the change in the focal transgressor   from the leader in general to the supervisor  we can also see that some established typologies such as the competency vs  integrity violations framework   do not include person  focused transgressions i e   behaviors that violate interpersonal norms and  attack  a person s self concept and self esteem   we further observe that the power and hierarchical status differ  ences characterizing leader follower relationships become more evident in certain transgression types than others  for example  performance criticisms  undersupplied resources  underprovided recognition  unfair employment decisions  favoritism and abuse of power are more likely to be leader based transgressions  on the other hand  transgression types such as dishonesty and incompetence can equally apply to both leaders and followers  our tripartite framework offers a broad taxonomy for both leader and follower transgressions and does not explicitly ac  knowledge issues related to power or hierarchical status differences  we nonetheless discuss such issues in detail in later sections where we present our integrative framework   and most specifi  cally in relation to the relationship repair strategies a transgressor or a victim may employ after a transgression   when reviewing past typologies  we also notice that attempts to qualitatively differentiate between transgression types  such as grover et al    s classification of transgression typologies into recoverable   and unrecoverable   mix boundary conditions and attributional processes in the content of transgressions  recovery is not an inherent characteristic of the transgression type but dependent upon the victim s attributions and the transgressor s beha  vior  the exact same transgression   may be recover  able if the victim makes  for example  an external attribution and or the transgressor engages in a relationship repair strategy such as an apology  table   a classification of existing transgression typologies   existing typologies task focused person focused ethics focused  general robinson and bennett   • production

leadership quarterly             but it will be irrecoverable if no action is taken  similarly  the dis  tinction of active and passive transgressions offered by basford   mixes intentionality and the attributional processes a victim will engage into within the transgression content  this creates a  messy  and con  fusing picture of leader follower transgressions   the impression that a reader gets when reviewing existing typolo  gies is that of continuously  re inventing the wheel  and although the insights on the content of transgressions are valuable  they do not help move the field forward towards addressing more interesting theoretical questions and dynamic phenomena  we hope that our tripartite fra  mework can offer an overarching framework of leader and follower transgressions that future research can utilize to delve deeper into this complex phenomenon   the way forward on definitional issues  from the previous discussion it becomes evident that existing de  finitions and typologies of transgressions adopt a narrow and static view  a  slice in time  lens of a complex temporally unfolding phe  nomenon  existing definitions   generally define transgressions as leader actions that violate organizational norms   but fail to capture    the transgression content  i e   whether the transgressions are task   person  or ethics focused    the relational nature of leader follower transgressions  past definitions mainly view transgressions as actions that violate organizational norms and do not acknowledge the importance of leader follower relationship norm violations  and   their event based occurrence and dynamic essence  past definitions remain silent regarding the temporal nature of transgressions  we define leader   transgressions as leaders    actions that violate the established task focused  person focused or ethics focused norms and expectations in the leader follower relationship  transgressions are key events in a leader follower relationship which diverge from the stable or routine features of leader follower interactions and trigger re evaluation of the relationship   transgressions represent critical incidents    nega  tive events    a jolt     dis  continuous happenings    or a shock in the leader follower relationship and are thus far from routine and continuous  given their event based occurrence  the transgression event strength   is of importance  characteristics such as criticality    no  velty   and disruption   need to be taken into account when studying leader fol  lower transgressions  events of low severity  low novelty and low dis  ruption are unlikely to even enter the potential victim s   awareness sphere and thus their implications for the leader  follower relationship and organizational outcomes will be minimal  on the other extreme  transgression events of high severity  high novelty and high disruption are likely to be anchoring events   in the leader follower relationship  anchoring events are marked by extreme emotional and instrumental content  are en  coded in autobiographical memory and have significant effects on the individual  the relationship and work related outcomes  such high im  pact transgression events can serve as anchors based on which sub  sequent leader follower exchanges and relational events will be eval  uated   on the other hand  events of high severity and disruption but low novelty will imply some form of abusive supervision and destructive leadership in general    thus  transgression event novelty   can be a qualifying condition that differentiates leader follower transgressions as  discontinuous happen  ings  that diverge from routine leader follower interactions   from abusive supervision  destructive leadership   and toxic followership   phenomena where norm violating behaviors are routine and stable patterns of leader follower interaction  abusive leadership is a broad literature that has been the topic of several re  views   and falls beyond the scope of this review   in sum  our definition extends existing conceptualizations of leader  follower transgressions by acknowledging that    they can be quali  tatively different in terms of task   person  or ethics focused content    they are fundamentally of a relational nature as they take place in the context of leader follower relationships  and   they are not static  snapshot  phenomena but instead discontinuous events in the leader  follower relationship that can trigger relationship re evaluation pro  cesses over time   relationship repair strategies  after addressing transgression content and definitional issues in the previous section  we now shift the lens of our review to the relationship repair strategies that leaders and followers can employ after a trans  gression event   transgressor strategies  prior literature on relationship conflict and trust repair   has mainly identified four dominant strategies that transgressors can use in restoring damaged relationships and trust    offer accounts for a violation in an attempt to deny  reduce  or explain their culpability    offer an apology    de  monstrate concern for the victim  and   show penance  the role of the transgressors in promoting   prosocial transformation and forgiveness through their actions has also been highlighted by rusbult  olsen  davis  and hannon    they defined amends as the trans  gressor s inclination to accept responsibility for a transgression  offering sincere apology and genuine atonement  amends may exert beneficial effects on victim cognition and emotion  thereby enhancing the prob  ability of prosocial victim transformation  for example  by discussing the incident in a concerned apologetic manner  the transgressor may help the victim develop feelings of empathy  thereby promoting a more positive emotional state  or may identify extenuating circumstances  thereby promoting less malevolent attributions regarding the trans  gressor s motives     one of the common relationship repair strategies that has been examined in the existing literature is the transgressor   offering an apology  apology is defined as a statement by which the offender acknowledges the transgression and asserts their respon  sibility for it    as noted by basford et al     apologies are a  forgiveness  seeking strategy     and the most fre  quently used technique when individuals pursue forgiveness    basford et al    provide two theoretical explanations as to why apologies are effective in eliciting forgiveness and repairing re  lationships  in goffman s   view  apologies enable offenders to disassociate their bad self from their good self  apologizing enables an individual to detach the part of the self that is transgressive from the part of the self that is regretful thus enabling the good self to be for  given  along with this  splitting of the self  theory    other theories provide arguments as to why apologies are often viewed as effective image restoration and relationship repair tactics  according to correspondent inference theory    victims make presumptions about offenders considering the extent to which the transgression is under the offender s control and the extent to which the offender benefits from it  by apologizing the offender may  o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             convey the message that the harm was not intentional  that its con  sequences are also harming the offender  and that the offender merits forgiveness  even though these two theories differ in some respects  they are aligned on the view that apology should facilitate forgiveness     in addition to being just a verbal expression of remorse  grover  abid dupont  manville  and hasel   observe that higher quality apologies involve empathy  acceptance of responsibility and compen  sation in the form of penance    in their conceptual model of leader follower reconciliation  andiappan and treviño   identified sincere apology as a repair effort that leads to forgiveness  this notion has been supported by meta analytic evidence which im  plies a strong link between apology and forgiveness     victim strategies  forgiveness is a rapidly growing area of research that holds promise for understanding leader follower relationship development after a transgression    existing forgiveness con  ceptualizations are quite diverse   but they share an important common feature  i e   the assumption that forgiveness is a complex transformational process  which involves prosocial change regarding a transgressor on the part of the trans  gression recipient  as mccullough  fincham  and tsang   point out    nearly every theorist appears to concur that when people for  give  their responses   towards a transgressor become more positive and or less negative     maio  thomas  fincham  and carnelley   further tested the idea that the process of forgiveness is intrinsically different across diverse relationships and found important asymmetries in associates of forgiveness across parent child and parent parent re  lationships  they also pointed out that forgiveness is an evolutionary adaptation that protects relationships and that unforgiveness is related to avoidance behavior   scholars have begun to investigate forgiveness in organizational contexts  including the notion of leader follower forgiveness  in their  review  cameron and caza   underline the power that forgiveness has on individual and collective outcomes  in a similar vein  caldwell and dixon   argue that love  forgiveness and trust are the core values of contemporary organizational leaders who strive to maximize value for organizations while enabling employees to realize their full potential  fehr and gelfand   pointed to levels of analysis issues when studying forgiveness in organizational settings and proposed the concept of forgiveness climate which they defined as    the shared perception that empathic  benevolent responses to conflict from victims and offenders are rewarded  supported and expected in organizations     along similar lines  bies  barclay  tripp and aquino   further argued that forgiveness must be studied as a multilevel phe  nomenon  embedded in context  as   a part of a system of inter  connecting psychological  social  structural  and cultural relations      review of existing research  procedure and general findings  given the importance of leader follower transgressions  we con  ducted a detailed search of the leadership related transgressions lit  erature to assess the current state of the field  to identify publications for inclusion in our review  we searched web of science and ebsco databases  the specific search keywords we used were  leader  or  leadership     and  one of the following terms   transgressions    betrayal    offenses    trust violations    re  lationship repair    trust repair    forgiveness    apologies    amends  and  revenge   our first search yielded   results  we then excluded papers that were not written in the english language  conference pa  pers  dissertations  books and book chapters  this second search yielded   papers  we then focused on papers published in the fields of psy  chology    business and management as our emphasis is on leader follower relationships in organizational contexts  the result of this second step was   articles  we then read the title  abstract and main content of each of these papers  this final step revealed   relevant articles published since   that have focused on leadership and followership transgression related constructs and it is                                                                              leader transgressions follower trangressions trust in leader repair leadership and betrayal

transgressions  trust in leader repair  betrayal  forgiveness  apologies  amends and revenge  in the article title or abstract in   year increments since     o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             evident that this number is rising    interestingly  our search did not yield any relevant papers prior to    as can be seen in fig     the majority of articles   have adopted a leader centric perspective focusing mainly on leader transgressions whereas there is only a very small proportion   explicitly examining follower transgressions  a substantial part of the literature has examined re  lationship repair strategies  with forgiveness   and apologies   being the two dominant streams  it also becomes evident that there is a substantial growth of this literature in the last eight years which we anticipate will continue   in analyzing the literature  one of the first observations is that there is a fragmentation of the leader follower transgressions and the re  lationship repair literatures  transgressions and relationship repair strategies have evolved as separate lines of research and there is limited integration between the two streams  researchers have either examined leader follower transgressions and their outcomes or relationship repair strategies   and outcomes  relatively few studies have attempted to examine the dynamic relational process that unfolds after a leader or follower transgression has taken place  the transgressor s and the victim s actions and reactions and relationship outcomes    this fragmentation becomes evident in the keyword co occurrence analysis we did as part of our review using vos viewer    fig    visualizes the co occurrence networks of the most important terms extracted from the body of literature on leader follower transgressions we have reviewed and presented in fig     in vos viewer  constructs are represented by their label and by a circle  the size of the label and the circle of an item is determined by  the weight of the item  lines between items represent links  the closer two constructs are positioned to each other  the stronger their relat  edness    in order to construct this visual construct map  we utilized three pieces of information from the papers included in this review  keywords  title and abstract   as can be seen in fig      transgressions    forgiveness  and  apolo  gies  emerge as nodes with high co occurrence frequencies but the communication   between these streams of literature is limited    there is  thus  a need for an integrative framework addressing the dynamic relational pro  cesses underlying leader follower transgressions in organizational en  vironments   we now proceed with a closer examination and a more detailed discussion of the reviewed papers and summarize findings on table    table   is structured around types of transgression    who the transgressor is    the transgression target    relation  ship repair strategies and outcomes   a first observation from table   is that the vast majority of trans  gressions in the current literature are ethics focused with most domi  nant one that of dishonesty  leader dishonesty transgressions included deceiving followers  abusing their power  making promises while being aware they cannot keep them  cheating  offering a bribe in order to influence decision making  and many others  ethics focused transgres  sions thus appear to dominate the existing literature   table   further confirms our vos analysis finding of a disconnect between research on transgression typologies and research on  fig     keyword co occurrence mapping of the leader follower transgressions and relationship repair literature   o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             relationship repair processes and outcomes  there are seven studies examining leader ethics based transgressions    a relationship repair strategy   and outcomes together   and one study examining a task focused transgression    a relationship repair strategy   and outcomes    the vast majority of studies have examined the direct relationship between leader fol  lower transgressions and outcomes   furthermore  none of the reviewed studies examined more than one transgression type and a few studies asked participants to think of leader transgressions in general without specifying the content  for example  shapiro et al    asked participants to    think about a leader in their employing organization who had done something that caused them to feel disappointed in him her as a leader due to actions at work whose appropriateness was questionable    and then to  open endedly describe what their leader had done  shapiro et al    content coded these transgressions into the eight types presented in our section on typologies  they subsequently found that leaders who were perceived to be more competent and inspirational were less punitively evaluated by employees for leader transgressions  lmx   was found to be a significant mediator  furthermore  employees who punitively evaluated their leaders were more likely to have turnover intentions and to psychologically with  draw from their organization  similarly  radulovic et al    in their field studies asked participants to think of leader transgressions they had experienced before completing the surveys  in their study    they asked participants to specifically think of the eight transgression types proposed by shapiro et al    before answering   with regards to transgression target  the majority of studies presented in table   focus on the dyad     and few studies  table   overview of articles focusing on leader and follower transgressions  relationship repair strategies and outcomes   transgression

leadership quarterly             focus on group level      an explicit acknowledgement of the transgression target can contribute to a more nuanced under  standing of leader follower transgressions by taking into account the multi faceted nature of the specific phenomena   the role of transgression severity has been addressed in a few studies    for example  offence severity has been found to be an important determinant of punitive actions that people are willing to impose on deviant leaders    byrne et al    found that offence severity moderated the positive association between leader apologies and follower s psycholo  gical well being  furthermore  offence severity moderated the associa  tion between leader apologies and their positive emotions and psy  chological health  more recently  grover et al    examined the conditions under which apologies facilitate restoration of trust in the leader follower relationship  it was found that the impact of apologies on forgiveness and subsequent trust depended on leaders  intentions and the severity of the trust violation s outcomes  transgression severity  is thus an important moderating variable that needs to be taken into account in empirical investigations of leader follower transgressions   finally  we could not find any longitudinal studies in the leader  follower transgressions literature  only radulovic et al    used a time lagged design in one of their three studies to examine the med  iating role of forgiveness in the relationship between lmx and follower attitudes and subjective well being  thus  time and the temporal nature of leader follower transgression events have been completely ignored by existing research   outcomes of leader and follower transgressions  with regards to outcomes  the articles examined a variety of out  comes such as turnover intentions    psychological withdrawal    trusting intentions    moral reasoning    attribu  tions of blame    among others  from a multilevel perspective  most of these outcomes can be positioned on the individual   or dyadic level    table      transgression types transgressor transgression target  relationship repair strategies

case study cels    o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             and none of the studies has explicitly addressed group level outcomes  in a field study of   employees  shapiro et al    found that leaders who were perceived to be more competent and inspirational were less punitively evaluated by employees for leader transgressions  furthermore  employees who punitively evaluated their leaders were more likely to have turnover intentions and to psychologically with  draw from their organization   abrams  randsley de moura  and travaglino   have examined forgiveness as an outcome in situations of transgressive captains and players in sports teams and tested the hypothesis that people forgive serious transgressions by ingroup leaders but not by other group members or outgroup leaders  across five studies  they found evidence for a double standard in evaluations of the transgressive targets  in  group leaders were granted special license to transgress    more recently  abrams et al    once again found support for the deviance credit hypothesis  their studies showed that ingroup leaders benefited from both accrual of prototypicality and conferral   of the right to depart from existing norms  zheng et al    have also examined forgive  ness as an outcome and specifically argued that a victim s withheld   forgiveness promotes transgressor compliance when the victim has low power  relative to the transgressor  in the case of high  power victims there were high levels of compliance from the trans  gressor  regardless of whether they expressed or withheld forgiveness   tumasjan et al  s   study examined ethical leadership per  ceptions as an outcome of leader transgression and found social dis  tance to moderate the extent to which leaders are perceived as ethical after moral transgressions  they further found ethical leadership to influence lmx  karelaia and keck   examined punishments after transgressions and found an interactive effect of deviance severity and leader status on recommended and actual punishments  leadership status was found to protect its holders in the case of low severity transgressions but was a liability in the case of high severity trans  gressions  bauman et al    also studied punishments and found that people were less punitive when low ranking transgressors imitated high ranking members of their organization    however  imitation only reduced punishment when the two transgressors   were from the same or  ganization  when the two transgressions were similar and when it was unclear whether the high ranking transgressor was punished  wang and chan   utilized moral licensing theory and found that when lea  ders demonstrated prior unethical behaviors  followers  who were the victims of the leaders  transgressions  felt liberated to act in transgres  sive ways   regarding follower transgressions  our literature search yielded only six articles that addressed follower transgressions and findings are also summarized in table    desmet  hoogervorst  and van dijke   s studies looked at follower punishment and showed that in  creased market competition made leaders  disciplining of ethical transgressions contingent upon the transgression s instrumentality to the organization  leaders tended to punish the same ethical transgres  sion less when it resulted in profit for the organization than when it resulted in loss  van houwelingen et al    examined whether leaders may be unwilling to enforce moral norms and punish followers because of a negative attitude towards these norms  their studies showed that leaders that construe norms on relatively low   levels are more likely to see norms as obstacles  whereas leaders that construe moral norms on high   levels have a more positive view of norms and are thus more willing to punish transgres  sing followers  wang and murnighan   also examined follower punishment and uninvolved observers  trust in the leader  their studies showed that observers trusted leaders who administered large or medium punishment more than leaders who administered no punish  ment when transgressors deserved punishment  they also showed that people trusted punishers more than non punishers  but only when punishers  motives were not personal revenge   shao   examined leaders  expression of moral anger as an outcome and tested two paths through which leader moral anger affects follower trust  a character based path and a relationship based path  the results from two experimental studies did not provide support for the character based path but provided some support for the relation  ship based path between leader moral anger and follower affective trust  it becomes evident from table   that the majority of studies ex  amined leader s punishment of the transgressing follower as the main outcome and that follower transgression outcomes are mainly on the individual and dyadic level    once again  no group level outcomes have been examined  wang and murnighan   s study  however  has looked at third party reactions   and offers an interesting extension beyond the leader follower dyad  it is highly problematic that the current literature totally overlooks the impact of followers  transgressions on leader specific outcomes or leaders  per  ceptions of the leader follower relationship  the leader s punishment of the transgressing follower   is still a follower centric outcome  existing research thus gives the erroneous impression that leaders are impervious to followers  transgressions  recent research has called for a more interactional perspective and highlighted the need to shift the focus and examine follower influences on leader outcomes such as well being    future research examining the impact of follower transgressions on leaders  psychological states  behaviors and attitudes can advance our understanding of the mutual interplay of leader follower transgression phenomena   relationship repair strategies  in this section we review strategies for relationship repair from both the transgressor   and victim   perspective found in the reviewed studies  as can be seen in table    two key main strategies are observed  with regards to transgressor strategies   leader apologies  are the main focus of existing studies  when it comes to victim strategies   forgiveness  emerges as a key strategy and an important relationship maintenance mechanism   transgressor strategies in their survey based study  basford et al    investigated how  followers evaluate leader apologies and how these perceptions influ  ence work related outcomes  specifically  they examined leader trust  worthiness and its impact on subsequent leader apology  perceived humility and perceived transformational leadership  this serial mul  tiple mediation process  in turn  influenced trust in leader  satisfaction with supervision  lmx relationship quality and organizational com  mitment  forgiveness was shown to mediate the link between leader apology and the outcomes including lmx   in another survey based study  byrne et al    found that leader apologies had a positive impact on followers  psychological well being and emotional health  which was moderated by offence severity  their second study showed that leader apologies had a positive impact on their own psychological well being  positive emotional health and au  thentic pride  furthermore  the nature of transgression moderated the link between leader apologies and leaders  positive emotions and au  thentic pride  while offence severity moderated the association between leader apologies and their positive emotions  psychological health  and authentic pride     cels   investigated public apologies that corporate and gov  ernment leaders made following organizational transgressions  their qualitative case research showed that leaders use ethical leadership strategies developed for the organizational context and adopt them to the public context  in particular  the study identified four strategies that leaders employ   articulating values in relation to past and future    defining the wrongdoing    constructing moral communities   and  differentiating responsibilities      o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             in a similar vein  grover and hasel   examined how leaders recover following public revelations of their sexual indiscretions  using qualitative case research  the authors found that the survival of a scandal depended on several factors  including the extent to which the indiscretion deviated from accepted norms  the extent to which the behavior differed from leader s expressed values  the leader s power  and whether the leader engaged in atonement  the connectedness of these elements showed that atonement was possible if the behavior was neither too severe nor beyond their character and the leader was powerful enough  drawing on this research  grover and hasel   examined how leader s ethical behavior outside of work impacts fol  lower attitudes towards them  a scenario based study showed that ethical leaders are hurt by sex scandals more than unethical leaders  and that meaningful apologies are fruitful for personal responsibility but not for transgressions rooted in an official abuse of power   interestingly  stouten and tripp   showed that following a transgression  followers profit more from apologizing and asking for forgiveness than leaders do  in two experiments using a social dilemma context where the norm of equality was violated  they showed that apologizing and asking for forgiveness led to less negative affect  more forgiveness and less revenge for follower transgressors but not leader transgressors  the authors explain these results by noting that leaders and followers are held to different rules and fairness violations can be tolerated from leaders but not from followers     victim strategies more recently  scholars have begun to investigate forgiveness in  lmx relationships  thompson and simkins   investigated the impact of two distinct forgiveness motives  self oriented and other or  iented  on lmx relationship quality  in the authors  view  self oriented forgiveness motive is rooted in self interest and rational calculation while other related forgiveness motive is rooted in empathy and com  passion for the offender  a field study involving undergraduate pro  fessionals and a time lagged study involving graduate professionals from the usa found that high quality lmx relationships and inter  personal citizenship behavior can be enhanced by both types of for  giveness motives  the authors further demonstrate that the link be  tween forgiveness motive and lmx can be enhanced by one s disposition  in particular  proactive personality enhanced the impact of self oriented forgiveness motive on lmx  and empathic concerns en  hanced the impact of other oriented forgiveness motive on lmx   drawing on the relationship science literature  radulovic et al    proposed and tested a model of forgiveness in lmx relation  ships  a field study involving employees in various organizations in both individualistic and collectivistic countries   showed that higher quality lmx relationships led to higher follower s job satisfaction and subjective well being via greater follower s forgiveness and subsequent follower s relational efforts    furthermore  an experimental scenario study involving undergraduate students showed that lmx positively affected forgiveness and that forgiveness climate was a significant moderator  lastly  a time lagged study involving working professionals from the usa found that the indirect effect of lmx relationship quality on follower outcomes was enhanced by forgiveness climate  in general  their three studies elucidate the process of forgiveness in lmx re  lationships and demonstrate that forgiveness can be used as a re  lationship maintenance strategy that generates positive outcomes fol  lowing a workplace transgression   in summary  it becomes evident from the above discussion that existing research has focused on a narrow repertoire of transgressor and victim relationship repair strategies  namely apology and forgiveness  expanding the lens to include other relationship repair strategies such as accounts and penance could offer valuable insights in the future  in addition  prior research has been completely mute on whether leaders engage in relationship repair strategies when they are themselves vic  tims of follower transgressions  do leaders employ forgiveness as a  relationship repair strategy  under which circumstances and with what outcomes    this is an inter  esting question for future research to tackle   theoretical underpinnings of the reviewed studies  prior studies have utilized a wide range of theories to cast light on leader and follower transgressions  scholars such as abrams et al    have drawn from the idiosyncrasy credit theory of lea  dership and social identity theory   to address how in  group prototypical leaders are granted  deviance credit  by their fol  lowers  drawing from idiosyncrasy credit theory of leadership  shapiro et al    investigated the conditions under which leaders avoid punitive evaluations for their offenses  radulovic et al    utilized social exchange and lmx theories to investigate forgiveness as a re  lationship repair strategy and its positive outcomes  karelaia and keck   have used role schema theory to investigate the extent to which deviance severity and perceived rights and responsibility of leaders influence punitive actions directed at deviant leaders  bauman et al    have drawn on social learning theory and psychological theories of blame to explain how unethical behavior by higher ranking in  dividuals modifies the ways in which people respond to lower ranking individuals who then commit the same offence  stouten and tripp   have drawn on equity theory and social dilemma research to investigate the reactions of group members following the violation of equality norm by either a leader or a follower  zdaniuk and bobocel   have used the insights from idealized influence leadership to investigate whether leaders who nourish follower collective identity enable forgiveness among employees  drawing on deterrence theory  zheng et al    showed that withholding rather than expressing forgiveness enables the victims to gain offender compliance when the victim has low power compared to the offender  the framework of ethical leadership is also widely used among scholars  for example  cels   investigated how executives demonstrate ethical leadership when public apologies are needed   on the basis of the above discussion  the absence of a coherent theoretical framework for examining leader follower transgressions is evident  we will later attempt to offer such an overarching theoretical framework by drawing from rusbult s   interdependence theory and relationship science   measurement and methodological issues  as can be seen in table    a variety of methodologies have been employed to study transgressions and relationship repair strategies such as critical incident technique    interviews    and surveys   whereas the vast majority of studies have utilized experimental designs    indeed  more than half of the articles presented in table   used experimental designs  most often experimental vignette methodologies    this is not surprising considering the fact that evm has been a popular method in ethical decision making studies    evm is a suitable methodological approach to study leader follower trans  gressions as it allows for experimental control over the manipulated antecedent and can offer important insights on the causal relationship between transgressions and outcomes  nonetheless  evm has short  comings and especially the lack of scenario realism and result gen  eralizability have been raised as a major criticism  evm can suffer from limitations related to  hypothetical studies    that do not elicit actual behaviors as they do not have real world tradeoffs or payoffs    these in  clude misrepresentation of self report assessments  proneness to de  mand effects and social desirability responses  among others  aguinis  o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             and bradley   suggested that the realism can be improved if the level of immersion of the participants increases  they suggested use of audio  video and pictures as a way to increase the realism of leader  follower vignettes  also  virtual reality technology   is another media type that can be used to present more immersive and realistic vignettes  lonati et al    also advised researchers using evm to employ  non traditional stimulus materials  which can enhance the psychological realism and the immersion in hypothetical experimental environments     another shortcoming of evm is the threat of omitting important variables  given that the number of variables that can be manipulated and examined in an evm study is small  this issue becomes evident in the studies reviewed in table   as all experimental studies presented focus on one transgression type and a few trans  gression outcomes or one relationship repair strategy and a few related outcomes  thus  such methodology cannot capture the complex  dy  namic and multifaceted nature of leader follower transgressions  re  lationship repair strategies and outcomes in organizational settings  evm is still a useful methodology in this particular research domain as it can offer insights on whether a causal relationship exists but cannot help us understand how the leader follower transgression processes unfold over time   to answer the second question  different methodologies need to be employed  first  the use of sequential experiments  in which the pos  tulated chain of cause effect relationships is examined cumulatively in separate experiments  can help to test process models and also alleviate the problem of endogeneity bias    second  longitudinal multi wave studies and latent growth model designs can be utilized to explore transgression dynamics over time  also  experience sampling methodology and daily diary   methods can be used to un  derstand within person processes   over time  such methods have been widely used to study dynamic within person processes involving affect  behavior  workplace events and transient phenomena in organizational settings    a specific esm approach that could be suitable for leader fol  lower transgressions research is event contingent reporting which re  quires study participants to provide a response each time a discrete event of a particular type   occurs  despite its advantages such as ecological validity  ex  amination of within person phenomena and memory bias reduction  esm is not without limitations    self selections bias and sample attrition are important shortcoming as the heavy demand placed on participants may bias the final sample towards highly conscientious individuals  reactivity may also be pro  blematic for esm studies as the repeated assessments may lead parti  cipants to pay unusual attention to transgression incidents which may unduly magnify the transgression effects   leadership research can further benefit from utilizing event study analysis methodologies commonly used in economics    economists are often asked to measure the effect of an economic event on the value of a firm and their event study analysis starts with a clear definition of the event of interest  identifi  cation of the event window and subsequent choice of a  short horizon  versus a  long horizon  method of study    leader follower transgressions studies in applied settings need also to clearly define the transgression event of interest and carefully choose the transgression event window the study will examine   qualitative methodologies such as process studies can be further utilized as they utilize ethnographic  discourse analysis and other methods to uncover how and why things emerge  develop  grow  or terminate over time    narrative analysis   can offer an in depth look at people s experiences of leader and follower trans  gressions via their own stories and narratives  such analyses can be further supplemented by computer aided text analysis   methods that can enable the quantitative analysis of narrative data based on  word frequencies  cata methods hold considerable promise for leader  follower transgressions research due to its high internal  external and construct validity but issues related to measurement error variance need to be also addressed by prospective studies     as we also see in table    field studies are generally rare   due perhaps to the difficulty of obtaining organizational approval to study transgres  sions  field studies are also constrained by the lack of an established measure of leader follower transgressions that can be used in organi  zational surveys  despite the multiple typologies discussed in definitions and typologies section there is lack of a coherent framework utilized in survey research and prior field studies mainly asked whether transgressions have been experienced      we believe that our tripartite transgression framework   offers a useful platform for the development of such a scale and for a more systematic measurement of transgression phenomena in applied research   furthermore  it is important to acknowledge the dyadic and at the same time multilevel nature of leader follower transgression phe  nomena  prior research has highlighted the misalignment of theory and methodology examining such dyadic phenomena   and the pseudo unilaterality   pre  vailing in existing research  we observe such pseudo unilaterality in the context of leader follower transgressions research  most studies mea  sure victim   perceptions of the transgressive in  cident as well as their subsequent behaviors and outcomes whereas very few studies additionally focus on the transgressor s perceptions and behaviors after the event    such an approach disregards the fundamentally relational nature of leader follower transgressions  transgressions are dyadic situations in the sense that they occur within work relationships between individuals   who are primarily nested within dyads and further nested in higher level units such as teams and organizations    meth  odologies such as the actor partner interdependence model   as well as one with many   models can be useful in studying leader follower transgressions  whereas apim designs focus on unique dyads that do not share members with other dyads  owm designs focus on dependent dyads in which multiple partners   share a focal person    in organizational contexts  we normally encounter dependent leader follower dyads and thus owm models may be more appropriate  reciprocal owm designs in particular consider multiple perspectives on an interpersonal interaction or relationship and provide a more complete picture of the multifaceted nature of re  lational phenomena  also  repeated measures owm models can cast light on how a leader follower relationship is unfolding after a trans  gression incident   as a general comment  in all quantitative approaches discussed in the previous sections  endogeneity issues need to be addressed  endogeneity refers to situations when a predictor variable is correlated with the error term of the outcome variable    endogeneity biases can mainly result due to   omitted variables    designs that do not take account of simultaneity and   measurement errors    endogeneity biases can potentially render results uninterpretable   and thus they need to be explicitly addressed  for ex  ample  a cross sectional study examining followers  perceptions of lea  der s transgressions    a relationship repair strategy such as forgiveness   and turnover intentions   would be affected potentially by all three endogeneity biases  the cross sectional design cannot address causality and simultaneity  there will be mea  surement error due to common method variance and followers   o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             perceptions of the leaders  transgressions are likely to be influenced by a series of exogenous variables such as their personality  implicit lea  dership theories  positive and negative affect and so forth  randomized control experiments are considered to be  the gold standard method  for estimating causal effects   and thus the experimental designs that have been widely employed in leader fol  lower transgressions research   potentially help overcome endogeneity issues  with regards to field studies  instrumental variables can be used to combat endogeneity biases  instrumental variables are exogenous predictors   of an endogenous predictor  examples of in  strumental variables include individual differences    demographic or biological factors    or geographic factors  none of the studies we reviewed explicitly performed instrumental variable analyses such as  sls and this is an important limitation of existing research in this domain   leader and follower transgressions research can further advance by borrowing methodologies from other scientific fields  for example  agent based modeling methodologies    currently used across various disciplines    can potentially be utilized to capture the complex  dynamic  interactive processes underlying leader follower transgression and relationship repair phenomena  agent based systems modeling   is a powerful simulation technique that allows re  searchers to model phenomena in which multiple individuals   situated in a social system   influence one another through their interactions    specific events   can be modelled and the process of how lower level interactions   can yield higher level outcomes   over time can be captured    grand  braun  kuljanin  kozlowski  and chao   state that the first step in an absm analysis is    a narrative theory of what individuals do  think  feel  that gives rise to a higher level outcome      the integrated model we present in an integrative model of leader follower transgressions  re  lationship repair strategies and outcomes from an interdependence theory perspective section can provide the basis for such a narrative theory of the leader follower transgressions process that could poten  tially be modelled in absm   finally  leader and follower transgressions research can borrow methodologies from neuroscience  prior neuroscientific research has studied brain activation patterns in the process of forgiving and has found specific brain areas to be associated with forgiveness and speci  fically the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex  posterior cingulate gyrus and right temporo parietal junction    strang  utikal  fischbacher  weber  and falk   used fmri methodology to investigate brain processes involved in receiving an apology and active forgiveness of an ambiguous offence  they found that receiving an apology yielded activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus  the left middle temporal gyrus  and left angular gyrus and that forgiving judgments activated the right angular gyrus  although neuroscience research on transgression related topics and forgiveness remains in its infancy  the scope for future research clarifying the neural mechanisms underlying transgression and relationship repair mechanisms is vast   theoretical integration and future research directions  in previous sections  we reviewed existing literature on leader fol  lower transgressions  relationship repair strategies and outcomes and critically discussed the current state of the particular research domain with regards to its definitional  theoretical and methodological chal  lenges  the need for a unified theoretical framework that can help capture the dynamic relational process of transgressions and repair processes over time became evident  below we offer an integrative  model that synthesizes the existing literature and utilizes insights from rusbult s   interdependence model as its theoretical foundation   interdependence theory and insights from relationship science  theory and research from the multidisciplinary literature on re  lationship science   can enhance our understanding of re  lationship maintenance processes in leader follower relationships following a transgression  while some distinctions between personal and workplace relationships exist  there is arguably sufficient overlap for cross fertilization    for example  both close non work and leader follower relationships are typified by mutual influence  high trust  reciprocal liking  coordinated goals  responsiveness  and the provision of various kinds of resources and support    in addition  the relationship science literature emphasizes a number of generic re  lationship maintenance strategies that could be fruitfully generalized across virtually all kinds of relationships     interdependence theory is the central theoretical framework in re  lationship science and in a similar vein to lmx theory it is guided by the logic of social exchange and reciprocity    rusbult s   investment model stems from interdependence theory and its central principle is that dependence on the relationship is a function of both the extent to which the relationship meets the in  dividual s most important needs and the quality of alternatives for sa  tisfying such needs  dependence in turn leads to relationship commit  ment which is enacted by both parties adopting maintenance strategies to ensure that the relationship is perpetuated at the desired level    the investment model broadly differentiates between two forms of relationship maintenance mechanisms  cognitive and be  havioral  cognitive maintenance strategies serve to diminish the ne  gative impact of transgressions on relationship perceptions and can be likened to a first line of defence against relational damage  the cogni  tive approach treats relationship transgressions as  in part  socially constructed  and thus as much in the eye of the beholder as in the be  havior of the beheld    in contrast  behavioral maintenance strategies are more effortful and involve either the inhibition of destructive behavior or the promotion of constructive behavior in response to transgressions  behavioral maintenance tactics are more likely to be needed in the face of serious relationship trans  gressions that cannot be easily condoned or explained away     it is important to note that the literature on leader follower trans  gressions has largely overlooked the role of cognitive maintenance strategies  here we briefly review three kinds of cognitive maintenance tactics    first  people can idiosyncratically interpret the transgression in ways that enables them to maintain a positive view towards the leader follower relationship  for example  murray and holmes   found that os  tensibly negative behavior   can be interpreted as positive behavior    and that this flexible reinterpretation can help to maintain relationship perceptions over time  that said  the relabelling of transgressions is likely to be psychologically taxing  and in the case of serious offenses may not be always possible without ap  pearing misguided     second  it may be possible to recast the transgression by considering it in the broader context of other positive behavior  this tactic of re  integration is akin to saying   yes  but    in other words  the trans  gression is acknowledged but offset by desirable characteristics  murray and holmes   provide examples of such integrative thinking in their research on close relationships  couples were asked to write  o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             narratives describing both the development of their relationship and their partners  greatest faults which revealed many serious character flaws    nevertheless  the significance of such faults was downplayed by integrating them with compensatory virtues  and the capacity to engage in such integrative thinking pre  dicted greater relationship stability  based on this logic  those people who cognitively cluster transgressions and compensatory positive be  havior together may more effectively maintain leader follower re  lationships than those who cluster them separately     finally  it may be possible to reconstrue the transgression by attri  buting it to a benign cause that diminishes the transgressor s responsi  bility for the offence  this tactic of reattribution can be likened to saying  yes  because    for example  research on close relationships reveals that some people attribute their partner s most egregious be  haviors   to important virtues    people can also discount such behavior by attri  buting it to some temporary  external causal factor  indeed  such con  genial attributions can result from in depth cognitive processing in which people consider the extent to which the perpetrator transgresses in different situations and across time     in contrast  the literature on transgressions in leader follower re  lationships has paid some attention to the role of behavioral main  tenances strategies  in line with the investment model  and as reviewed above  there is growing recognition that certain behavioral tactics used by both the transgressor   and the victim   can be effective in repairing the leader follower relationship  here we highlight the role of accommodative behavior  a victim instigated relationship maintenance strategy that has received considerable at  tention in the relationship science   literature    in the context of relationship transgressions  accommodative behavior represents the willingness to restrict the urge to reciprocate in kind and instead to respond constructively   theory and research on behavioral accommodation is rooted in the investment model and the exit voice loyalty neglect typology of re  lationship conflict    according to this ty  pology  the four possible responses to a transgression can be dis  tinguished on the basis of two dimensions  activity vs  passivity and destructiveness vs  constructiveness  exit reactions are actively de  structive    whereas voice reactions are actively constructive    loyalty reactions are passively constructive   whereas neglect reactions are passively destructive      the good manners model of re  lationship conflict suggests that it is less important that people display constructive behaviors  rather that they do not display destructive be  haviors due to the disproportionately harmful effect of destructive acts    thus  behavioral accommodation helps maintain re  lationships by  nipping problems in the bud   and in doing so it prevents a downward spiral of negative reciprocity that is destructive to re  lationships   as discussed earlier  a central principle the investment model is that of partner dependence which in turn leads to relationship commitment and the adoption of relationship maintenance strategies    applying this logic to leader follower relationships there are good reasons to believe that followers should be more motivated to maintain the relationship than leaders  first  leaders typically have better access to important resources   than followers  and therefore followers are likely to be more dependent on leaders than leaders are on followers  second  given that a leader has many followers but followers only have one leader  a leader has dis  proportionate access to alternative relationships for meeting his her needs  hence  if a follower routinely transgresses  rather than undertake  the psychologically difficult process of repairing the relationship  a leader could transfer this investment to an alternative   follower  followers  by contrast  are in essence  stuck  with the leader  the upshot of this discussion is that leader follower relationships are likely to be more important to followers than to leaders  and thus fol  lowers should be more inclined to engage in maintenance strategies than leaders   an integrative model of leader follower transgressions  relationship repair strategies and outcomes from an interdependence theory perspective  let us now examine what happens after a leader or follower trans  gression event has taken place  from an interdependence perspective    in the aftermath of a transgression  the victim   may find it difficult to depart from the negative affect associated with the incident  when victims experience negative transgressor directed emotions  such as anger  a reduced motivation to engage in relationship repair strategies can be expected  conversely when victims experience positive trans  gressor directed emotions such as empathy  an enhanced motivation to forgive can be expected    reconciliation fol  lowing a significant transgression entails mutual investment  whereby both partners exert significant  coordinated effort to achieve a desired end state  i e  restored dyadic functioning  critical in the process is the pre transgression relationship commitment    ac  cording to finkel et al    strong commitment promotes positive mental events  pro relationship motives and forgiveness  a second component of commitment involves long term orientation and for  giveness might be a conscious or unconscious means of maximizing long term self interest  a third component of commitment involves broadened interpersonal interests  in committed relationships  the motives of self and partner may become compatible to the extent that departures from self interest benefitting the partner are not experienced as antithetical to self interests    commitment may thus inspire other oriented actions that benefit the relationship  and therefore the self   in order to understand leader follower transgressions and relation  ship repair processes we propose an integrative model in the leader  follower relationship context  this model is presented in fig      guided by rusbult s investment model    as well as the research of fehr et al     we propose that victims  prosocial motivation transformations occur via   mitigating cognitions regarding transgressions and transgressors    positive rather than negative af  fect  and   relational  dispositional and situational boundary condi  tions for relationship repair  for the process to begin  the transgression must first enter awareness  i e  one member of the dyad to realize that the other has violated the relationship norms  this is an important stage that does not follow the same pattern for leaders and followers  as recent research on employee deviance has highlighted  leaders may be less accurate when assessing workplace mistreatment or even unable to detect it due to limited and screened information     affective reactions after the transgression enters awareness  the initial reaction is often  one of shock  repression and denial    the injured dyad member often feels deluged with mixed emotions such as hurt  anger  anxiety and sadness  the empirical literature reveals that following transgressions  victims experience diverse negative emotions and emotional reactions vary as a function of the nature of the dyadic relationship  reactions generally tend to be more negative in highly committed relationships     cognitions according to attribution theory    relationship repair strategies such as forgiveness emanate from a  o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             victim s perception that the transgressor and offence are decoupled   that the offence was not an act of volition but rather a product of cir  cumstance  if a victim makes internal  global and stable attributions of a transgression   he she may be more likely to react negatively towards the transgressor  in contrast  external  specific and unstable attributions   might be more likely to lead to positive behaviors towards the transgressor     in the dyad context  relational attributions are also likely to occur    victims   based on their relationship history will make relational attri  butions about the cause of a transgression event within the relationship    eberly et al    argued that relational attri  butions lead to relational uncertainty and anxiety  thus  dyad members will be more likely to proactively seek to repair their relationship through relationship repair strategies when they make relational attri  butions than when they make individual attributions as the ones we described earlier   boundary conditions in our model we highlight a series of boundary conditions that are  likely to affect cognitive and affective reactions to a transgression in  cident  first  transgression event criticality or severity is of importance  the effects of transgression severity have been examined in many close relationship studies    bradfield and aquino   showed that blame attributions were influenced by of  fence severity  furthermore  it was shown that a global information  processing style increases willingness to forgive by making the offence appear less severe    perceived severity of the critical incident significantly predicted whether or not a victim engaged in forgiveness    fehr et al    s meta ana  lysis found severity and forgiveness to be negatively correlated  offence severity has also been found to be an important determinant of punitive actions that people are willing to impose on deviant leaders    byrne et al    found that offence severity moderated the positive association between leader apologies and follower s psy  chological well being  furthermore  offence severity moderated the association between leader apologies and their positive emotions and psychological health  more recently  grover et al    examined the conditions under which apologies facilitate restoration of trust in the leader follower relationship  it was found that the impact of apologies on forgiveness and subsequent trust depended on leaders  intentions and the severity of the trust violation s outcomes  transgression severity is thus an important boundary condition that needs to be taken into account into empirical investigations of leader follower transgressions   second  transgression event novelty or frequency needs to be taken into account  as discussed in the way forward on definitional issues section  transgression frequency can distinguish transgressions that are novel  non routine  discontinuous happenings  in a leader follower re  lationship from phenomena where norm violating behaviors are routine and stable patterns of interaction such as abusive supervision   and toxic followership     third  the transgressor s hierarchical status is an important boundary condition  i e   whether the transgressor is the leader or the follower  prior research has highlighted the role of the hierarchical status for forgiveness  aquino et al     for example  argued that victims will not seek vengeance when the power dynamics of the situation make the  relationship repair  strategies  leader  follower  relationship  relationship quality  hierarchical status individual differences  schemas  hierarchical status individual differences  schemas  transgression type  target severity  frequency  post transgression  relational attributions relationship re evaluation  pre transgression transgression  event  relationship resilience  cognitions emotions  cognitions emotions  relationship repair  strategies  fig     an integrative process model of leader follower transgressions  relationship repair strategies and outcomes   o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             costs of doing so too high and that a victim may find it more ad  vantageous to maintain a relationship with a high status transgressor than with a low status transgressor  thus motivating prosocial coping responses and discouraging revenge  given that a transgressor of a higher hierarchical status can more negatively impact the victim than a lower hierarchical status transgressor    due to the fact that the former may influence desired outcomes    the victim may refrain from pursuing re  venge because he or she fears the loss of these outcomes     they also suggested that people with higher hierarchical status may find it particularly insulting to be harmed by a lower status follower so they may believe that an aggressive response is necessary to enforce social deference  forgoing the opportunity to enact retaliation would be to relinquish the opportunity to demonstrate their superior power  thus  those in a more powerful position are likely to be less motivated to forgive  whereas those with less power may be more inclined to forgive     kramer   also investigated trust enhancing and trust de  creasing behaviors as a function of where people were at in the hier  archical ladder in the organization  the results showed that because of their greater dependence and vulnerability  trust concerns were stronger for individuals in low status positions  interestingly enough  zheng et al    found that an apology   from high  power transgressors was relatively ineffective in increasing forgiveness from low power victims and this moderating effect was mediated by victim cynicism   fragale  rosen  xu  and onypchuk   focused on subjective rather than hierarchical status and found that transgressor s status af  fected attributions for the transgression incident and specifically ob  servers attributed higher intentionality to high  relative status trans  gressors rather than low status transgressors    in the case of high intentionality attributions  one would expect less in  clination for observers to forgive  it is  however  important to note that there was no relational dependency or a hierarchical relationship be  tween transgressor and observers in their study  observers were not relying on the transgressor for valuable resources and rewards and this may well explain the differential results   finally  the pre transgression quality of the leader follower re  lationship is likely to be an important boundary condition in this con  text as we expect the relationship repair process to be different in the case of high versus low quality leader follower relationships  high quality leader follower relationships are characterized by high levels of dependence  commitment and relationship satisfaction and thus leaders and followers in such relationships will be more inclined to make benevolent attributions of the event and to show pro relationship transformation motivation and reach forgiveness    committed and satisfied partners tend to attribute negative ex  periences to transient and external sources and even in the face of de  clining relationship quality they maintain optimism    thus  in leader follower re  lationships of high quality  transgression victims will generally tend to make benevolent attributions and attribute the transgressor s behavior to more uncontrollable  transient  external sources  view transgressions as more incidental  and the transgressor as less responsible for the transgression  in contrast  victims in low quality leader follower re  lationships   will tend to make distress maintaining  malevolent attributions and view transgressions as more internal  permanent and under the control of the transgressor  and thus more likely to ascribe intentionality and culpability   as can be seen in fig     after the stage of transgression awareness and relevant cognitions and emotions  the next stage involves trans  gressor behaviors that can contribute towards the relationship repair process  transgressors   can engage in a series of behaviors in order to address the transgression  the role of the trans  gressors in promoting   prosocial transformation and  forgiveness through their actions has been highlighted by rusbult et al     transgressor s relationship repair strategies such as an apology are likely to promote positive affect and thus create the conditions for prosocial transformation of motivation  whereas lack of relationship repair action is likely to induce negative affect  also  regarding victim cognitions  at this stage  after having acquired more information about the factors contributing to the transgression  injured parties may begin to develop revised explanations for their partner s behavior  enright et al    in their theory of forgiveness refer to a strategy entitled  re contextualizing  the transgressor  meaning that the injured partners can reconstrue the transgression by placing the act in the broader context of the relationship and environment  acknowledging the con  text might cast light on the partner s decision to engage in the betrayal  for example  organizational crisis conditions might explain why a leader didn t grant a promised reward to a member or fear for one s job security might explain a verbal outburst and snapping incident on be  half of the member  maio and thomas   describe this process as akin to the victim saying  yes  but   or  yes  because   taking into account the surrounding conditions  the good history of the relation  ship  or the transgressor s otherwise good character can alleviate the sense of transgression   alternatively  negative framing may also occur  which can accent  uate the sense of transgression  for example  reflecting upon one s pre  existing knowledge of the relationship  especially past transgressions may heighten the perception of injury or harm  putting the event in context and changing the attributions for the event can result in a new understanding of oneself  one s partner and the relationship  in the final stage of the relationship repair process  both leader and follower have ascribed meaning into what has happened  strong emotions have sub  dued and are ready to act on what happened  victims can now choose one of three behavioral strategies to react    grant forgiveness    opt for some form of retribution  i e  some form of revenge or punishment    and   opt for refuge  whereas restitution and retribution are in some fashion  making up for  the transgression  refuge is more a demand for protection or proof that the event will not happen again    refuge might involve either an emotional or physical distancing from a hurtful partner  they hurt me once  so i will not let them get close enough to hurt me again    the role of individual variables certain individual variables will enhance or inhibit victims  ten   dencies to engage into relationship repair strategies such as forgiveness  prior meta analytic work on forgiveness in close relationships has highlighted the role of three dispositional variables  agreeableness  trait forgiveness or forgivingness and perspective taking    among the big   personality factors  agreeableness is most frequently linked to forgiveness  it is defined as the tendency to get along well with others  when faced with a conflict event  agreeable people seek co  operative and integrative solutions and are also likely to understand and empathize with others  situations    trait forgiveness is conceptualized as the tendency for an individual to forgive across situations and time    individuals high on trait forgive  ness tend to interpret offenses as worthy of forgiveness whereas those low on trait forgiveness tend to interpret offenses as unworthy of for  giveness and perceive retribution or refuge as the most useful strategy   perspective taking represents a cognitive capacity to consider the point of view of another person    within the context of forgiveness  perspective taking has been shown to enhance victims  understanding of why the transgressors might have offended them and facilitate prosocial transformation of motivation    furthermore  prior research   has highlighted the role of narcissistic enti  tlement for forgiveness  narcissistic entitlement involves expectations of  o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             special treatment and preoccupation with defending one s rights  in  dividuals high in narcissistic entitlement have been found to be less willing to forgive and more skeptical of forgiving in general  in fact  exline et al    have reported narcissistic entitlement to be a ro  bust  distinct predictor of unforgiveness   schemas  such as implicit leadership and followership theories   can also play a role in re  lationship repair processes  a victim   may be more willing to forgive a transgressor who matches their leadership   prototype as prototypical transgressors enjoy  deviance credit  and license to transgress    relational schemas may also be important   in this context  prior research   has shown that leaders and members form different relational schemas  leaders de  velop schemas focused on work related issues whereas members are focusing more on interpersonal concerns  these differential schemas may trigger a different evaluation process of observed transgressions   with implications for subsequent re  lationship repair processes   outcomes at three levels of analysis we expect a series of possible outcomes of the relationship repair  process of a transgression based at three levels of analysis    specifically  on the individual level  possible fol  lower outcomes may include reduced turnover intentions and psycho  logical withdrawal    well being and positive emotion    fairness percep  tions    moral identity   and follower ocb and voice    from the leader s perspective  possible individual outcomes include perceived leader integrity and trust in the leader   and moral identity salience   following relationship repair  other possible outcomes that have not been examined by prior research include leader efficacy and leader identity  for example  after effective resolution of a transgression event  leaders may experience renewed granting of their leader identity   and increased confidence in their ability to lead  leaders may also experience negative individual outcomes such as diminished power base  lower leader identity and efficacy and social rejection   and increased employee deviance     after follower transgressions  followers may experience punitive and authoritarian leadership behaviors and transactional   exchanges with the leader  however  if the leader grants forgiveness it is possible for the relationship to return to pre trans  gression levels of outcomes in terms of follower well being  job sa  tisfaction  follower identity and leader trust   relationship resilience is a key outcome of a relationship repair process after a transgression  relationship resilience is demonstrated when leaders and followers restore their relationship to the status quo or exhibit positive adaptation and growth after the transgression    other dyadic outcomes may include increased relational effort    and relational trust   as well as enhanced leader fol  lower relationship quality  furthermore  given that leader follower dyads are nested in groups  group level outcomes may occur  group  level outcomes may include forgiveness climate    justice climate   and group perfor  mance  for sake of parsimony  we do not present all possible outcomes in fig    apart from relationship resilience which is fundamental for relationship continuance   transgression antecedents and triggers  although not explicitly presented in our model in fig     future research could also identify specific  transgression event triggers and antecedents  for example  prior research in the close relationship literature has shown that attachment orientations predicted transgression frequency and reactions towards a partner s transgression    specific transgression event triggersmay also be identified such as uncertain environmental conditions  organizational changes and performance pressures   or ego depletion factors     other future directions  as previously discussed  time is generally an important parameter that needs to be explicitly conceptualized and operationalized    time is a key factor for experiencing a transgression in a relationship  for relationship repair and relationship outcomes in the aftermath of the transgression  generally  transgressions early in a relationship can be damaging   in the sense that the relationship might never recover as relationship  norms have not been fully established  on the other hand  transgressions that happen later in established relationships can yield deeper damage than if the violation occurred earlier before relationships were formed and commitments made    in these circumstances  the violation is a shock and it is worse than unreliability or deception because it violates a deep trust and confidence in a longer term relationship     identity is also a promising line of research in the context of leader  follower transgressions relationship repair strategies and outcomes  krylova et al  s   review has already offered an identity perspec  tive utilizing social identity    moral identity   and identity threat   theories  they argued  for example  that when leaders transgress and behave in a manner that is incompatible with prototypical group attributes  they are redefining the group prototype  the ambiguity created by the transgression creates a discord between the leaders  behavior and the followers  moral identities which can be identity threatening  we fur  ther argue that transgressions can have implications for leader and follower identities    leader efficacy and follower self  concepts  trickle down effects of transgressive behaviors  similar to ethical   or abusive leadership   can also be examined  for example  a middle manager who is the victim of their leader s transgressions may then emulate similar trans  gressive behaviors in their relationships with their own followers   in sum  we believe that we have offered an integrative model and a broad future research agenda that the interested researcher may find useful when conducting research in the field of leader follower trans  gressions  relationship repair strategies and outcomes   conclusion  recently there has been considerable research focusing on leader and follower transgressions and relationship repair strategies  in this review  we have critically synthesized this growing literature  discussed conceptual and methodological challenges  offered suggestions for de  finitional clarity  added new insights based on closed relationship sci  ence perspectives and outlined an integrative framework for guiding new directions of research in this field  addressing relational trans  gressions between leaders and followers can be a challenging process  however  the utilization of relationship repair strategies can have a transformative effect on the leader follower relationship through re  defining relationship norms and boundaries  multiple outcomes on the individual  dyadic and group levels for both leaders and followers can be expected to follow the relationship repair process  we consider this an exciting field of study and we hope that future research will  o  epitropaki  et al  the leadership quarterly             empirically integrate transgressions  relationship repair strategies and outcomes as well as explicitly address their events based nature  their complex unfolding over time  boundary conditions and levels of ana  lysis issues   references  abrams  d   randsley de moura
