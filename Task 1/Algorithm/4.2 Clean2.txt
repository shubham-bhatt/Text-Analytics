the alt right throughout the west  there has been a renewed interest in the leadership of fringe political groups  although it is neither a political party nor a social movement as typi  cally defined  the alt right s influence on mainstream journalism  pol  itics  and even governments has been indisputable  while the sensa  tional political approaches of the alt right have been garnering a large amount of recent press  there has been less work investigating the leadership processes within these forms of socio political vanguards  although some references have been made to the leadership of and within these groups in the social movement literature  very little has been done in other literatures  and of the work that has been done  much of it has often been peripheral to other investigations  with the focus of these prior studies being primarily on issues apart from the leadership of vanguards  given the important role of leadership of vanguard groups in today s political environment  a review and in  tegration of this past work with more recent leadership research is overdue   this paper will begin by reviewing what literature exists regarding the leadership of socio political vanguards  as well as what additional literature exists that may also be relevant to better understanding the phenomenon of vanguard leadership  vanguard leadership will then be placed within the historical context and goals of past vanguard groups   this analysis will then lead to further defining some of the components of vanguard leadership along with a review of typically associated leadership behaviours   while few theories directly speak to the way in which vanguard leadership operates  this paper will also review related leadership the  ories that might offer meaningful contributions to our understanding of socio political vanguard leadership  some theories  such as those re  lated to social movements    minor but influen  tial political parties  and advocacy activist collectives are particularly relevant here and will be reviewed  along with more general leadership theories that might also hold applicability  such as those related to leader and follower   information processing and sense  making under crises  the paper will then conclude with an evaluation of the extant literature and some prescription for future research di  rections   some key questions that this paper will address include      what are socio political vanguards and what constitutes vanguard leadership      what are its goals     what does vanguard leadership look like

be doing   socio political vanguards   definitions and historical background  the definition of a socio political vanguard   is one that has evolved quite a bit since lenin   one of the first to popularize the term in its political sense   began to theorize and apply it as a strategic approach back in the early   s  the term has roots in military expeditions   it described the most forward unit that would disrupt the enemy and secure ground in advance of the main army  lenin later developed the idea of a vanguard as a party   comprised of dedicated members   often intellectuals and activists   whose primary purpose was to spread marxist concepts and educate the proletariat in marxism  while disrupting the status quo  in lenin s case  the status quo being the imperial russian government     since then  the term vanguard has evolved to include groups of intellectuals and activists that work towards spreading their own par  ticular brand of political ideas    often through propaganda and other forms of agitation  in an attempt to subvert and overthrow the prevailing mainstream culture and   ulti  mately   the political establishment  given the importance of the communication function within the vanguard approach  it is little sur  prise that a large number of contemporary socio political vanguards have either emerged from cultural vanguards or have had a strong cultural component  groups such as the futurists  and the situationists   were both initially aesthetic movements that eventually grew to in  corporate and extend socio political elements   drawing from its military pedigree  the term as presently used also suggests a separate unit and one that is in advance   more forward   than other groups engaged in a similar fight  albeit to a more moderate degree and in quite different environments    in the socio political sense  this implies that a vanguard is  ahead of the characteristic beliefs and norms of the wider society    and in direct contestation with those status quo beliefs and norms  while the larger social movement is more moderate and in line with the public s belief  values  and worldview   this in fact is a key differentiator between vanguards and their counterparts  social movements  as has been noted by bill moyer  mcallister  and finley     movement activists will be successful only to the extent that they can convince the great majority of people that the movement  not the elite power holders  truly represents soci  ety s positive and widely held values and sensibilities   he goes on to note that  movements are self destructive to the extent that they are defined as rebellious  on the fringes of society  and in opposition to the society s cherished core social values  symbols  rituals  beliefs  and principles   this latter warning of course is an apt description of van  guards  while behaving in such a way would be self defeating for many social movement leaders  these defining factors are often levers of profound influence for vanguard leaders   this division speaks to the evolving perspective on vanguards as groups that are somewhat autonomous   and not inherently a direct part of the political process  rather  vanguards work to shift public consciousness to set the stage for other individuals and social movements to effect political change  political parties are typically defined as organizations that seek to influence public policy by getting its candidates elected to public office  party members share the same ideology and run electoral campaigns based on political platforms linked to this ideology  in this respect  political parties are entrenched in the structures of society and serve to link governmental institutions to elements of civil society  by contrast  vanguards also work to gain the attention of the mainstream public  but not as an institutionalized group or political party   they often diverge from party politics to concentrate their impact on shifting cultural and political norms or  public mindshare   vanguards do not see themselves as participating members of the status quo political process and typically do not have as a goal becoming a part of it in the immediate future   while vanguards are sometimes similar to interest and activist groups in some of their tactics  their missions generally account for more than one issue   they often have an entire worldview they are trying to bring to fruition  one that is typically utopian    and while the propaganda and agitation that van  guards put forward often lends support to some social movements and  or their primary political goals  it is important to draw distinctions between the actions of vanguards and those of mass social movements as they often quite differ in how they work to achieve political objec  tives  particularly in terms of mission  strategies  and tactics   historical reviews of past social change sometimes further muddy the distinctions between different leaders involved in these periods  while hagiographies of prominent social movements often describe leaders as  vanguards  at early stages in their movements    many such leaders actually espoused positions that  while cer  tainly challenging  were still more moderate and socially acceptable forms of vanguard positions of the same period    this conflation of vanguards with the beginning phases of social movements further overlooks a key strategic pillar of vanguards that was developed as far back as lenin  namely  that van  guards are best employed as levers for change when juxtaposed with mass social movements  in effect  as vanguards open up political space in the consciousness of the public through direct contestation  mass social movement agendas appear less challenging extreme   similarly  while some mass social movement leaders have been er  roneously labeled vanguard leaders due to loose criteria and histor  icization of the beginnings of social movements  the proper definition and delineation of vanguards has also suffered from later violence committed by some vanguard groups  this has led to further confusion  leaving the categorization of some vanguard leaders to either  social movement leader  or  terrorist leader   instead of more tightly defining    futurism promoted a  dynamic modernization     its advocation of violence contained both anarchist and fascist elements  filipo tommaso marinetti   authored the   futurist manifesto which advocated for the violent rejection of traditional forms of art in favor of the incorporation of modern technology and the use of violence as artistic methods  italian futurism as an avant garde soon became widespread across europe during the inter war period  marinetti wrote fascist manifesto in   and later became an active supporter of mussolini  marinetti himself actively supported the italian fascist regime and volunteered for military service during wwii  he became a notable force in developing the party philosophy throughout the re  gime s existence but did not insert himself directly into political life       the situationist international   was an international social revolutionary organization active from   to   made up of avant garde artists  in  tellectuals  and political theorists  founded by guy debord  while the in  tellectual origins of the si were rooted in marxist critiques of capitalism the underpinnings of this critique also absorbed into this a rejection of spirituality  hedonism  and avant garde art movements of the first half of the  th century  debord   was a french writer  artist  and theorist who authored the   book the society of the spectacle  both this book and debord himself are frequently cited as having been highly influential towards instigating the may   student uprisings in france  where both students and si members occu  pied universities as a revolt against modern day capitalist exploitation  the central activities of the si targeted the spread of commodity fetishism  or the  spectacle    meaning the reliance on objects rather than expression to mediate social relations   into every aspect of life and culture    although debord s name is often associated with the   uprisings  he himself did not participate directly in partisan electoral politics   r t  marcy the leadership quarterly             the boundaries between these groups     in the strictest sense  the primary goal of a vanguard is not to lead social movements  nor to commit violence  but to help shift the public s consciousness to such a degree as to make it more amenable to future political propositions that would lead to the vision that the vanguard espouses  those realized political propositions  however  and the social movement and or political party that might share or adopt them  are not the goal of a vanguard to propose or to become     further  being the leader of a vanguard requires a particular set of complex skills that do not always translate to the equally complex leading of mass movements and or political parties   there are few people that have the cognitive complexity as well as the wide ranging behavioral repertoire to be effective as leaders in all of these environ  ments    as a result  the general fate of most vanguard groups is not to transition to more mainstream political or even cultural success  but to either fade into obscurity if they fail to shift the public s consciousness  or to have their agenda co opted by more mainstream movements   if they are more successful   some recent examples of such vanguards include   the situationists and the alt right  both of these groups have proven to be very influential with inserting ideas into mainstream social and political debates  and have at times even created physical activity   that have disrupted mainstream societal expectations   attending to vanguards as a unit of study for the purpose of ex  amining leadership roles and strategies within these groups is important for a number of reasons  first  while infrequently attended to in the literature  the leadership of vanguards remains a very visible and no  teworthy subject of study that numerous disciplinary areas could shed important light on  and yet  it has rarely been the primary focus of investigations and has often been subsumed within other studies    second  the influence of counter cultural socio political groups appears to be a growing and significant force in shaping con  temporary political debates and expectations  this is evident in the way in which the alt right  to name just one recent vanguard  has made such a strong impact on north american political discourse in the past couple of years  its use of the internet in spreading information and platforms for sharing ideas has been extremely influential  in contrast to political parties which have typically wielded influence through cam  paign donations  promotion by public news  and electoral success  many of the present day social issues that have been taken up and worked through by the public began with vanguard members using anonymous forum boards  twitter hashtags  and social networking   third  the number of these groups also appears to be growing  with multiple groups vying for public attention and warring both with themselves and the public  and finally  while the long term effect of some of these present day groups such as the alt right has yet to be determined  there is plenty of evidence that past vanguards  such as the situationist international  have played an important role in helping to shape and inform the political landscape that we live in today   given these factors  a review which would primarily concentrate on these forms of vanguards and  in particular  the way in which leader  ship operates within these groups would appear to be of some present value  although not all leaders of vanguards go on to command political power    these forms of leadership have certainly been very in  fluential and thus warrant further investigation   vanguard leadership   context  goals  and levels of analysis  while the alt right has created a unique stir in the past couple of years    the alt right as a political vanguard is not as novel an entity as some journalists today might suggest  vanguards on the political right   have not held as prominent a place in the public eye since the   s  but the history of socio political vanguards in general is quite lengthy  although a somewhat  modern  phenomena    there have been a series of vanguards that have been very influential culturally and politically since at least the early   s   arguably one of the most influential socio political vanguards within the past fifty years was the situationist international    led by guy debord  the si is often credited with being one of the primary instigators of the civil unrest of may   in paris  france  the si began as an artistic avant garde  creating works of art that were in contesta  tion with the forms and meaning of the prevailing aesthetic and cultural styles of the day    they then moved into a political phase in which they adopted a central mission of combatting the  commodification and domination of social relationships in western society by the media and other cultural productions of the status quo  leading average people to live disconnected and increasingly meaningless lives that are in essence  scripted  by elites and intended to serve them      after moving into this political phase  guy debord and the si shifted their artistic efforts towards creating unique socio political strategies and tactics  which they then used to attack the hegemony of status quo power  some of these tactics included dÃ©tournement    extreme public displays    and the  construction of situations   which involved the creation of social ex  periences that would be free of or subvert the contaminating influence of status quo notions related to everyday ways of living     the alt right has clearly drawn from this legacy and has in  corporated a number of these same tactics    such as   â¢ the execution of subversive cultural approaches  such as dÃ©tournement   some alt right members  such as walt bizmarck  have  detourned  walt disney films and replaced their dialogue with alt right memes associated with immigration and iq   â¢ the development and dissemination of coherent social theory     â¢ extreme public displays   as evidenced by the provocative public appearances of alt right leaders like richard spencer    â¢ and the construction of situations which undermine and subvert status quo social assumptions   as developed through various real  world trolling initiatives such as the  it s ok to be white  poster campaign   all of these tactics serve an important function in breaking the public s  false consciousness     this is an important first step in achieving the primary goal of a vanguard  to shift the public s consciousness to a state that is more amenable to the political vision that the vanguard supports  explained more in cognitive terms  these tactics serve an important sensebreaking  sensegiving  and sensemaking function  these processes are no small matter as the outcomes of these tactics by the si were profound  the student occupation of the sorbonne in may  â² was greatly influenced by evolving situationist theory and practice    and the  r t  marcy the leadership quarterly             actions of these students in turn led to the civil revolts of may   in paris  france  similarly  the  alt lite    the more moderate and much larger faction of a growing  us populist movement leading up to the   presidential election   was greatly influenced by the alt right  having a high degree of overlap with their various tactics  strategies  and political positions  the alt lite in turn was highly influential in galvanizing support for donald trump in the presidential race of    helping in his election   given the great influence that these vanguards have wielded  it bears delineating further what leadership of such a group might entail  unfortunately  research on the leadership of vanguards has been quite limited and often embedded in larger studies of other phenomena  as well as spread across a number of literatures over time  and often conflated with other forms of leadership  to include leadership of social movements    activist lea  dership  cultural leadership    com  munity leadership    and the leadership of marginal political groups  while all of these forms of leadership hold some relevance and overlap with vanguard leadership   along with more general research on charismatic and ideological forms of leader  ship  leading for creativity and innovation  and leader cognition     none of these should stand alone as a proxy for vanguard leadership   in moving more closely to a better understanding of vanguard lea  dership  as differentiated from other forms of leadership  it might be helpful to first define some goals that might be particularly unique to the leadership of socio political vanguards at different levels of ana  lysis   inter organizational and societal level goals  the primary goal of a vanguard leader is to gain and then shift the public s consciousness to the socio political worldview of the vanguard  thus allowing the space for later groups and movements to further particular political agendas  doing so often means combatting the status and power of elites in well established social relationships through the transformation of these social relationships  given this hostile relationship towards elites  collaborations between leaders of vanguards and societal elites is often unlikely  necessitating tactical approaches such as propaganda and agitation  specht s   tax  onomy of social change   provides some nuance as to what vanguard leaders can expect from elites when working to change the status and power of relationships within a social system  specht sug  gests that there will likely be dissensus between vanguard leaders and societal elites  which in turn suggests that collaboration between the two will not likely be an option  given the imbalance in power between the two  there is also a threat that elites may try to co opt vanguard leaders and their ideas    leaving vanguard leaders with little choice but to avoid collaborating with the  enemy    given that collaboration with elites is typically not a viable goal for vanguard leaders  as it results in a less than optimal outcomes  other  strategic approaches for social change need to be devised and im  plemented  one approach relies on influence attempts aimed directly at the public  as vanguard leaders and their immediate followers often do not have any form of institutionalized political power  they need to commit to other ways to directly influence the public  such as engaging in protest and otherwise leveraging institutionalized forms of commu  nication  such as mainstream media channels    the desired outcome is to gain the public s atten  tion and  once this has been achieved  to then subvert their common understanding of politically informed relationships    while at the same time providing viable alternatives       gaining the attention of the public  however  is not an easy task  particularly today  there are now multiple channels of information and entertainment all vying for this very limited resource of public atten  tion  to be able to compete with all of these other channels  a vanguard leader needs to be creative and have a firm understanding of not only public interest  but also of what tools might best be used to create novel and sensational displays that will leverage this understanding  in the case of the situationists  guy debord once walked off a television set in the middle of an interview while commenting   we re not here to an  swer cuntish questions       similarly  richard spencer   a leader in the alt right   has given a number of provocative  televised speeches  one of which he infamously concluded with what appeared to be a  roman salute    this understanding and subversion of a public  mental model  has parallels to research on leader vision and the development of both a general and prescriptive mental model  in the case of vanguard leaders  it is vitally important that they not only have a strong understanding of their own mental model for prescriptive social change  but they also have a firm grounding in a more general model of public beliefs  values  and political assumptions    situationist critiques of mass political understanding  most no  tably in the development of notions such as the  false consciousness  of the working class  reflect some of this distinction between prescriptive and general public mental models  as do some of the critiques made by richard spencer on the difference between adopting an avant garde position in political struggles and one that is more mainstream  as in his commentaries on the political trajectory of paul nehlen   in developing an understanding of both of these models  a vanguard leader is then better able to create and implement strategic approaches that can effectively subvert elements of the public s general mental model  which in turn will then provide the space to offer viable political alternatives  in effect  a vanguard leader s task at the societal level is to first  sensebreak  a general public mental model of how social and po  litical relationships work  and then help move the public towards a prescriptive mental model through sensegiving      in doing so  they are not only calling attention to and making salient particular social and political problems  but they are further providing solutions to those problems   group level goals  given the size of the primary goal at hand   the shifting of the public s consciousness towards the worldview of the vanguard   a vanguard leader will need a group of dedicated followers to help in accomplishing this goal  as this goal requires a high level of intelligence to understand  as well as creativity to generate and implement effective strategies and tactics for dealing with it  it s little surprise that van  guards are often comprised of innovative intellectuals  activists  and artists  with these types of group members  a vanguard leader will need to know how to be effective in leading other creative people in teams     r t  marcy the leadership quarterly             scott  gaddis    strange      as well as providing the requisite au  tonomy for others to exert leadership  both within the team as well as with external constituencies  as these members are often highly capable and do not typically suffer from a lack of options  vanguard leaders must be up to the challenge of dealing with the some of the usual in  ternal threats that can occur in creative groups   as well as external threats    vanguard lea  ders must help provide resources that enable the team to do its work  to include the provision of emotional resources   as well as financial resources  when pos  sible  they must also help establish networks that link to other groups of like minded others and create useful alliances   an additional related leadership task is for vanguard leaders to provide exemplary role modeling to their immediate followers along with the general public  and to act as a living embodiment of the al  ternative political views that they are espousing  this example  espe  cially if picked up by vanguard group followers  can also further serve as a  demonstration project  to the public    effectively providing an enticing subculture for other potential members to con  sider adopting and enacting  these new ways of working and living help validate the superiority of the socio political approaches and identity that the vanguard group is proposing  likewise  the vanguard group can also be a way for a leader to further test and refine hy  potheses related to these approaches   individual level goals  at the individual level  vanguard leaders need to be able to create and implement novel strategies and tactics that will help gain and then shift the public s consciousness in the direction of the social and poli  tical worldview that they are trying to bring into being  this will re  quire the employment of a set of cognitive skills that will help with creativity and social innovation  such as effective forecasting and pro  blem identification  as well as having a foundation of expertise on which to build new mental models of  as well as new approaches to  their community s problems   additionally  vanguard leaders need to provide through their own analysis and behaviour a clear example of why their approach to social and political life is superior to the existing paradigm  they need to convince followers and potential followers that they are someone worth following  as suggested by shanteau    it is not enough that someone has the knowledge of an expert   they must also look like and behave like an expert  which is to say that they have the expected cognitive and be  havioral repertoire of a leader worth listening to   finally  as they are social and political outsiders  vanguard leaders need to maintain and defend the integrity of their individual and group identity  vision and platform in the face of sometimes great opposition by status quo institutions  such as the media  mainstream political parties  and governments  this means that they need to have and maintain a certain resilience when meeting mass condemnation   towards a model of vanguard leadership  a diagram of a model of vanguard leadership is shown in fig     which illustrates two primary routes of influence that vanguard leader attributes can have on effecting change  the route of leader influence on groups and group membership  which in turn affect mass society norms and values  and the route of leader influence directly affecting mass society without the intervening group variables  change in this context refers to  sensebreaking    sensegiving   and  sensemaking   which to  gether comprise a process of the public adopting new ideas and beliefs about the larger socio political setting  some of which may contradict earlier status quo norms and values  the figure provides a representa  tion of the effects of vanguard leader attributes into three basic  components  the level of individual leader behavior  the level of group behaviours  and the level of mass society behavior outcomes  before going into the model in detail  we first introduce its components below   the first route identifies vanguard leader attributes within a group setting as being relevant for strategic planning and culture setting  both in terms of the social political ideological parameters of the group as well as the group s organizational culture within and amongst the group members  the antecedent implications of the group members   interact with leadership attributes to shape the outcome behaviours of the group  these group behaviours include the creation of authoritative texts  the re purposing of existing cultural symbols into new representations of the vanguard    and worldview and lifestyle shifts  these in turn influence outcomes on mass society beyond the groups  in the form of large scale public sensebreaking  sensemaking  and sensegiving   the second route identifies the interaction of vanguard leader at  tributes with a leader s behavior within the public space and not within an internal group setting  such behaviours include public speeches and other displays of expertise  the publishing of authoritative texts  a publicly unyielding and uncompromising position on socio political issues and official displays of commitment  and other potentially sen  sational public displays which challenge acceptable status quo public behaviours  the outcomes on mass society   change in norms   are the same as those via the first route but bypass the element of a group setting  going directly from the leader to the public   the background setting of the general socio political context pro  vides an important contextual factor in this model of vanguard lea  dership  by way of providing the climate for which certain issues are more or less relevant  this background can include economics    the presence and severity of  crises     the general ideological worldview    the political landscape    and the presence and substance of other vanguards and so  cial movements within mass society   vanguard leadership traits  skills  and behaviours  due to issues such as the muddiness of definitions of vanguards  along with vanguard leadership being conflated with other forms of leadership such as  social movement leadership   there are few studies that can be said to have definitively focused on the different traits  skills  and behaviours of vanguard leaders  this is not to say that some studies have not come close though  particularly those that have fo  cused on  revolutionary  or  rebel  leadership   two excellent research studies on the theme of revolutionary lea  dership   rebel leadership  commitment and charisma in the revolutionary process   by james downton  and leaders of revolution   by mostafa rejai and kay phillips   highlight some of the strengths and weaknesses that can more generally be found in the literature when trying to define and better understand vanguard lea  dership  both of these studies provide individual  group  and societal level criteria that are important to consider when attempting to define vanguard leadership  such as the important roles that personality  motivation  and context respectively play in these forms of leadership  downton s rebel leadership attends more to vanguard leadership as the role is more tightly defined within this study  while the other   rejai and phillips  leaders of revolution   does in fact speak more to revolu  tionary leaders of mass movements  although both cover lenin  who was one of very few leaders who was both a mass movement leader and a vanguard leader  both researchers spend the rest of their studies covering quite different leaders   in their study  rejai and phillips note that defining and identifying principal revolutionary leaders was more difficult than they expected  and they go on to note that they ended up needing to distinguish  the  r t  marcy the leadership quarterly              real  revolutionary  leader  from the dilettante  the propagandist  the pamphleteer     these comments speak to some of the issues raised earlier with the conflation of vanguard leaders with mass social movement leaders  while few people would heartily accept being called a dilettante  both propagandist and pamphleteer are roles that van  guard leaders would immediately recognize and acknowledge that they need to regularly fill  interestingly  in a review of the revolutionary leaders that rejai and phillips covered  they have done well in not in  cluding conflating vanguard leaders with  revolutionary  leaders of mass social movements  for example  in their review of leaders that were involved with the events in france  may  â²  they note daniel cohn bendit and alain geismar   but fail to note guy debord or raoul vaneigem    this can be contrasted with downton s  rebel leadership  qualitative study wherein he also was investigating  revolutionaries     but gave more prominent coverage to leader such as malcolm x of the black muslim movement   and marian keech of the  end of the world  movement     although there have been few studies that have had vanguard lea  dership traits  skills  and or behaviours as a primary focus    there have been a number of historical re  views conducted on many of these vanguard leaders  sometimes re  sulting in rich case studies that can be mined for clues as to what traits  skills  and or behaviours these leaders might have had  through ana  lysing these historical reviews  we can begin to determine the different components of vanguard leadership at the individual  group  and so  cietal levels   individual level traits  skills  and behaviours  early life experiences in reviewing the histories of past vanguard leaders  it becomes clear  that many of them were forced to work through what rejai and phillips   refer to as  relative deprivation and status inconsistency   guy debord  leader of the vanguard situationist international  suffered a  number of hardships as a young child  debord s father died when de  bord was only four years old  this then led to his family losing their fortune and descending into poverty    his father s death  the loss of his family s fortune and status in society  coupled with the turbulence from world war ii  very likely contributed to debord s character  debord made numerous mentions of his childhood in his work  often noting that he had seen  nothing but troubled times and immense destruction        this same level of relative deprivation and status inconsistency is noted amongst other vanguard leaders as well  while maintaining ex  cellent grades in school  malcolm x often spoke of the crime and drugs that were also a part of his daily life in the neighborhood he grew up in as a child  similarly  many leaders of the alt right have spoken of the drug crisis and general decline of status of whites they feel has taken place within their own neighborhoods over the past couple of decades   these types of catalyst events have been shown to have large re  percussions for future leadership in the leadership developmental lit  erature    impacting attitudes  cognitive development  and behavioral skill de  velopment   traits and attitudes while it can be difficult to disentangle the development of particular  attitudes and traits from some of these formative experiences  and whether they would have been inherent and or further developed without these experiences  it is clear that many vanguard leaders share some of the same attributes  for example  it is clear that vanguard leaders would not rate very highly in agreeableness on the big factor five personality assessment  given the contentious nature of the mission of a vanguard  it would seem that this would come with the territory  similarly  it would seem that vanguard leaders often contrast with so  cial movement leaders in their degree of extroversion  with vanguard leaders  such as guy debord and malcolm x  being somewhat more critical of everyday social life  or in the least  more socially removed   than social movement leaders  who seem to be more positively energized by engagement with the public  it is also likely that  fig     model of vanguard leadership   r t  marcy the leadership quarterly             most vanguard leaders would not be very high in need for social ac  ceptance  as well as in conflict avoidance   given that many historical reviews of vanguards and vanguard leaders are either thinly veiled hagiographies or denunciations  it is difficult to determine how highly these leaders might rate on different personality factors  such as the light   and dark triads    vanguards do not typically suffer from a lack of very passionate supporters or detractors either  making it sometimes difficult to more objectively determine how these types of leaders might rate on these factors  drawing from the extremist literature    it s been suggested that serious psychopathology is rare amongst these types of radicals      and it is further unlikely that an  extremist personality profile  will ever be found     as might be expected  given the history of a number of socio poli  tical vanguards emerging from artistic vanguards    many vanguard leaders seem to have an  aesthetic and or romantic streak     for example  guy debord was an artist before  during  and after his leadership of the s i     more surprising  however  might be the artistic leanings of leaders of the alt right  a connection that has been far less publicized  for example  richard spencer has repeatedly referred to past vanguards throughout his career  whether through the naming of his internet podcasts    his suggestions that he always wanted to become an  avant garde theatre director   or in his discussions with other members of the alt right of past artistic and socio political avant gardes    others  like ramzpaul    have directly made references and comparisons to  samizdat    in relation to alt right information dis  semination  another alt right leaders  greg johnson    has just finished writing a  mani  festo  for the movement    millennial woes  in a recent podcast  even went so far as to suggest that the alt right is an art movement   these artistic leanings suggest that vanguard leaders may be taking in different types of information than the norm    such as information related to aesthetics and power  which often inform the ways in which people build their worldviews  an awareness and facility with these forms of information may be another fundamental difference between typical political lea  ders and vanguard leaders  as outsiders  vanguards may have a per  spective on status and social aesthetics that is arguably deeper than many status quo political leaders   cognitive skills drawing together these attributes with the previously discussed life  experiences  it is easier to see how past vanguard leaders might have been motivated to develop particular cognitive skills that would then later help them to be more effective in their roles  for example  given their background and traits  it is likely that they might develop multiple mental models of how society might effectively  work   this may be yet another differentiator between vanguard leaders and some other types of leaders  the depth and breadth of alternative mental models available to draw from and combine    mal  colm x spoke frequently of the different worlds that whites and blacks live in  despite living in the same community  while guy debord often detailed the struggles between social and economic classes  high  lighting their great differences  as a parallel  alt right intellectuals have frequently made mention of a large divide between social elites and the white working class   as elites have little incentive to venture out of the status quo  their  understanding of the issues of those from less privileged backgrounds becomes more limited  many vanguard leaders  who have had wider  ranging experiences due to the status inconsistency discussed earlier  could arguably have richer informed models  as well as unique heur  istics for problem identification  some empirical support for this comes from a recent study of sensemaking which found that the  more an actor s cultural capital is privileged by existing organizational sche  mata  the more likely it is that his or her disposition toward profession  centrism will promote sensemaking about organizational change that will not disrupt existing organizational schemata      research on marginalization and status quo deviance further supports that  outsider  experiences can lead to the richer development of alternative mental models and heuristics     one often overlooked advantage to having personally experienced deprivation and status inconsistency is not only in having a fuller un  derstanding of the experience so as to more effectively solve similar problems  but also in the building of coping skills to surmount future challenges  these enhanced coping skills then in turn build a resiliency that can be very helpful in facing future status quo rejection  facing rejection head on is no small task  as it is a considerable challenge to adaptively work through it    given that con  testation and social rejection is a fundamental part of being a vanguard leader  it s important that leaders of such groups have considerable resilience  having had past life experience with social rejection  and having overcome it  especially when it is considered to be unjust  may very well be the experiences that vanguard leaders need to face future challenges to the status quo   group level traits  skills  and behaviours  team leadership most past vanguards have been comprised of a small set of very  committed members    with other as  sociates filling roles of  allies   meaning that they generally serve as more of a support function  as originally conceptualized and im  plemented by lenin  subsequent vanguards have typically been com  prised of intellectuals  artists  and activists  the situationist international  as led by guy debord  was no exception to this and was primarily made up of painters  filmmakers  and architects  with some playing a primary role as political theorists  they hailed from a number of different countries  as well as class backgrounds  being able to draw from these varied skill sets and knowledge structures likely contributed to their creative output    as an artist himself  debord was able to draw from his own experience when executing particular leadership tasks at hand  such as distributing resources effectively to followers    this is no small point as resources are typically limited in vanguard operations and vanguard leaders need to well understand the roles that they are asking others to fill  leaders of other vanguards such as richard huelsenbeck   and filippo tommaso marinetti   were all artists as well   important resources that vanguard leaders must weigh and consider include not only financial support but emotional and intellectual mat  ters  creative and intelligent people  as those often found in vanguards  need a high degree of autonomy to fulfill their tasks  vanguard leaders  similar to scientists and artists  must cultivate a careful balance be  tween allowing creativity to manifest itself in tasks and ensuring that standards are met  some vanguard leaders  such as guy debord  have maintained this balance by allowing great latitude on the development of a task on one hand  but expelling those from the group that did not meet particular standards or did not deliver on a particular project    while vanguard groups  like the alt right  have maintained commitment and exclusivity through the sheer offense of their platform           the group   this management of deviance to internal group norms ex  tends to the effective management of deviance in the wider society  group members of vanguards are typically under a great amount of social pressure to conform and this is something that needs to be further managed by vanguard leaders   this exclusivity of vanguards contrasts sharply with social move  ment and political party approaches  which tend to work towards ac  cepting as many people as possible into their ranks and making as many concessions as is possible to accommodate them  sometimes even going so far as to render their agenda unrecognizable from its beginnings  in contrast  guy debord turned more people away from the s i  than he welcomed    there was a regular purging of the ranks of the s i   and once someone was expelled  debord never admitted them back  he notes in his autobiography that he  never sought out anyone  anywhere  and that his  entourage  was  composed only of those who came of their own accord and were capable of getting themselves accepted     similarly  groups such as the alt right have even fashioned jargon around the purging of members  creating the terms  cuckservative  and  alt lite  to define those that don t meet the ideological standards of the alt right   unlike social movement or political party leaders  vanguard leaders tend not to make concessions to deviations  this style of team leader  ship is particularly harsh  but there are elements to this approach that are arguably adaptive  vanguard groups are often under constant threat by elites within social and political systems  whether it be co optation of their agenda or  even more extreme  attempts at violence  there is literature  however  that suggests that there are ways in which a min  ority group can counter these threats by maintaining a close knit group of loyal members     one is by sending clear signals to potential members of their com  patibility with the group by purging incompatible others    another is by presenting a strong and unified front to the status quo  while some research suggests that there will likely be short term losses in these approaches  it also suggests that there will also be larger gains in influencing the majority over the long term   than if a more in  cremental approach were taken     team behavior as an instrument of leader influence  vanguard groups are not only  representatives of new socio political relationships  but they are also agents of change in helping to shift public consciousness  debord along with the s i  created and implemented a number of tactics with which to directly attack status quo understanding of the social environment along with providing solutions  these tactics  such as detournement and the  construction of situations   were designed to break social norms and help people reconnect with themselves  each other  and their en  vironment in ways that were not directly or implicitly socially en  gineered by the status quo    with detournement  the s i  would strip the dialogue from cultural objects  such as comics and films  and replace this dialogue with s i  informed theory  with the alt right  walt bismarck has repurposed old walt disney movies in the same way to help spread alt right ideas related to iq and immigration  in a si  milar fashion  alt right  trolls    have helped spread their message on the internet through the use of provocative  memes   further co opting status quo cultural objects   the s i  s  construction of situations  was an attempt to create social situations that were free from the contaminating aspects of elite social conditioning  to jar people out of their false consciousness  and thus help them create more meaningful social relationships    in a similar fashion  anonymous members of the alt right have instigated a number of  real world  interventions  such as the  it s ok to be white  campaign  a poster campaign which was designed to provoke the public and prompt white identity consciousness  through these social and cultural engagements   vanguard leaders are hoping that they are  waking people up    and offering them an enticing vision   of how new social relationships might work   inter organizational and societal level traits  skills  and behaviours  vanguard leader as credible public figure being a vanguard leader in the public eye is somewhat of a balan   cing act akin to the balancing act implied by some theories of humor    some theories of humor  such as benign violation theory    suggest that humor may come from moral violations that are simultaneously seen as benign  said another way  for something to be funny  it needs to both break moral norms and be acceptable on some level  similarly  for a vanguard leader to be optimally influential  they need to not only be someone who is provocatively breaking the norms that society espouses  but   at the same time  also need to be a credible public figure     as vanguard leaders are in contestation with the status quo and status quo institutions  there are many forms of power and influence that are not under their control  such as reward power or coercive power  and thus cannot help in establishing their legitimacy    to be influential with the general public  vanguard leaders must work towards acquiring and leveraging other forms of power  such as informational and expertise power  to be a true expert in the eyes of the public  however  is more than just having an important and helpful body of knowledge and skills at the ready  a vanguard leader must also look and behave like an expert to be accepted by the public as one    this means that a vanguard leader must take steps to executing behaviours that the public would recognize as being those of an expert   one way in which a vanguard leader can more readily be accepted as an expert is in the publication of authoritative texts    as head of the s i   guy debord wrote several highly influential books  the most important arguably being the society of the spectacle    in this book  debord details some of the s i  s most important critiques related to commodity fetishism  the mass media  and the  spectacle    the commodification and domination of social relation  ships in western society by the media and other  spectacular  devices as designed and implemented by the status quo  leading average people to live disconnected and increasingly meaningless lives that are in essence  scripted  by elites and intended to serve them    debord also wrote or co wrote a number of articles within the situationiste internationale  the official journal of the s i   similarly  leaders within the alt right  such as jared taylor and kevin macdonald  have published extensively  in both the more aca  demic  as well as in the popular  literature  kevin macdonald is a well  published  retired academic who has written a number of scholarly  peer reviewed articles in addition to his popular press publications in support of alt right political positions  jared taylor  who has also published widely  has been described by both his supporters and his critics as someone who brings a  measure of intellectualism and ser  iousness  to the alt right    as well as having a  cultivated  cosmopolitan  approach     the establishment of vanguard leader credibility  to include the vision of the vanguard  is also furthered through the actions of the immediate vanguard group  as suggested in the group level behavior analysis  vanguard groups are not only tools to execute particular lea  dership tasks    but they are also effective as demonstration projects  signaling to the public how and why the new norms and be  haviours encouraged by the vanguard lead to better outcomes for themselves and their relationship to others    in the  r t  marcy the leadership quarterly             case of debord and the s i   a large contingent of the students of both the university of paris and the university of strasbourg  were clearly influenced by debord and the s i  emulating the s i  through the de  velopment of their own situationist based theory and praxis  some students created and disseminated the pamphlet  on the poverty of student life  which some scholars have credited with leading to the further dissemination of situationist ideas  and the eventual crisis of may       in a similar fashion  leaders such as milo yiannopoulos of the alt lite   a more moderate  but larger offshoot of the alt right   garnered more media attention and were even more influential in creating the political space on the right that allowed figures such as jordan peterson and donald trump to become even more prominent    it is clear from these examples that the association with  and successful cultivation and recruitment of  other socially credible fig  ures  as well as the creation of a larger support bloc   can further contribute to vanguard leader credibility  the recruitment of socially credible people also helps ensure better vanguard group outcomes as these types of members are often more stable and more capable than those with no social cred  ibility   vanguard leader as provocateur while a certain amount of credibility is essential for vanguard in   fluence  a vanguard leader s ultimate goal is not public acceptance but public provocation and eventual opinion shift  this shift is often achieved by vanguard leaders through uncompromising public debates and other sensational public displays  along with being intriguing en  ough to capture and maintain the public s attention    public engagements should serve at least two key functions        a sensebreaking function  wherein the sensational message or messages being conveyed define and highlight status quo ap  proaches as problematic    and      a sensegiving function  wherein the sensational message or mes  sages being conveyed define and highlight vanguard solutions as viable alternatives to the status quo     debord and the s i  engaged in a number of provocative tactics in their ongoing battle with the status quo  to include their use of dÃ©tournement of popular forms of media  as well as their involvement in contentious   and well publicized   public debates  as defined in the internationale situationniste     dÃ©tournement is  short for dÃ©tournement of preexisting aesthetic elements     in practice this meant taking everyday cultural materials   and then editing them to      highlight the bankrupt nature of status quo norms and relationships  and     replace status quo implied and explicit notions with text and images that would reflect situationist solutions   as noted previously  vanguard groups typically favor direction confrontation with elites  often through mass market media channels  as collaboration is not a viable option given their mission    through dÃ©tournement  debord and the s i  sub  verted mass market cultural forms by replacing status quo notions found within them with situationist informed solutions   thereby  helping to first break maladaptive assumptions and then promote a shift in public consciousness     debord further promoted these shifts to situationist ideas through often contentious  public engagements  in one of the most outrageous interviews at london s institute for contemporary arts  debord was asked in a panel   what is situationism   to which he responded in french   we re not here to answer cuntish questions   and then stood up and walked out    there was an immediate uproar and this incident went on to become infamous  thereby further catapulting guy debord and the situationist international into the public eye   this incident is a good example of debord s ability to create pro  vocations that capture the public s attention and continue to resonate after the incident has passed  it also highlights debord s refusal to collaborate or be co opted by the mainstream  to even include the at  tempt at public understanding through the use of terms that debord considered constraining  it is clear from all of this that debord and the s i  were one of the more uncompromising vanguard groups of the past century     taking a page from the s i  playbook  leaders and group members in the alt right have also engaged in tactics such as dÃ©tournement  as well as been involved in contentious  well publicized public debates  richard spencer and jared taylor have both engaged in highly con  troversial public debates on the topics of race  iq  and immigration  along with hosting conferences and rallies in which alt right ideas have been actively promoted in both the mainstream press and social media  some well established members of the alt right  such as walt bismarck  have used dÃ©tournement to give new meanings to old walt disney films  while alt right trolls have employed dÃ©tournement for  meme making  on the internet   vanguard leadership theories and future directions  individual level leadership theories and future directions  earlier  it was suggested that vanguard leaders often exhibit a set of similar attributes that appear to be helpful in the leadership of van  guards  some of these attributes included both traits and skills  in terms of traits  it s clear that it would be helpful to turn to the wider  leader personality literature to see what constructs might further contribute to our understanding of vanguard leadership  given the contentious nature of the role  along with the inevitable social opprobrium  van  guard leaders clearly need to be resilient  as well as be able to work through potential mass social rejection    self esteem management  particularly as a measure of positive social approval  becomes an im  portant skill to have   other general traits that are likely to be important to vanguard leadership are contrarianism    conformity    conventionality    as well as   need for social acceptance  while present research seems to suggest that there are not likely to be serious pathologies amongst vanguard leaders  it is likely however that particular traits run through different vanguards  depending on their socio political approach  for example  alizadeh and colleagues found that a need for certainty was particularly important to some far right groups     this focus in the literature on members of extreme groups such as the alt right   points to a number of inter  esting  and potentially contradictory  future suggestions for vanguard leadership research  namely  should we expect the same personality profile from the leaders of vanguards as we do from those that are group members  for example  while some research in the creativity literature has suggested that those that hold more conservative    for one of the more sophisticated and funny examples of this approach  please see can dialectics break bricks  by rene vienet    film vienet dialectics html for a snippet  see here    watch v iezrmgnrst        r t  marcy the leadership quarterly                       viewpoints are less creative    the intellectual and artistic production of alt right leaders  to include the innovativeness of their socio political tactics  would suggest otherwise  this contradiction points to the need for more research into vanguard leadership and vanguard leaders   in terms of skills  one particularly important area to explore would be in the area of cognition  namely  leader cognition skills  as the primary goal of a vanguard leader is to prompt a socio political shift in the public s consciousness  a strong understanding of how this process works is vitally important  marcy   has proposed that this shift can be enacted by vanguard leaders and their groups through a sense  making process  the process begins with first having a strong under  standing of the general public s mental model of society and politics  as well as a prescriptive mental model that is the foundation for the vanguard leader s vision for socio political change  the vanguard leader  along with the vanguard group  then creates and implements tactics that help  break  concepts and relationships within this general public mental model  which then creates the space for  sensegiving  approaches to fill the gap   these different steps are typically served through different roles within vanguards  with front line activists often being the  sense  breakers  through provocative assaults on mainstream culture  and in  tellectuals often being the  sensegivers  through their production of authoritative texts  while this process has been theorized  the leader cognitive skills underpinning this particular vanguard social change process have not been detailed or empirically investigated  leader cognitive skills such as scanning and forecasting will likely prove im  portant   group level leadership theories and future directions  similar to the individual level  the available research literature at the group level presents a number of interesting questions and chal  lenges in determining its applicability towards better understanding vanguard leadership  for example  vanguard leaders and vanguard leadership has much in common with revolutionary leadership  social movement leadership  and political party leadership  within these forms of leadership  the role of charisma is often a fundamental com  ponent of leader follower relationships  with followers often wanting to identify with  and even emulate  some of these leaders  which leaders then leverage to accomplish group goals  for vanguards  however  leaders are often as combative internally as they are externally  often sowing long lasting acrimony  and distancing other group members  and unlike some social movements and political parties  these group members often have strong identities and social credibility  resulting in a less than a need for a charismatic relationship  if not all vanguard leaders depend on charisma to influence followers  then what do they do to achieve group outcomes   given that vanguards are often made up of intellectuals  activists  and artists  there is some evidence to suggest that a more pragmatic or ideological form of leadership is needed to influence group members    rather than di  rectly appeal to followers  identities  some scholars have suggested that some leaders carefully delineate category boundaries  differentiating the status quo and its interests from the interests of the vanguard  leaders establish the boundaries of who is considered to be a part of the group and a part of the status quo  which helps to reinforce an  us  versus  them  phenomenon  with respect to contesting the status quo  leaders present a vision that reflects the collective social identity and conveys a shared alternative social reality    this envisioned reality  simultaneously marginalizes proponents of the status quo as  them  while aligning the rest of  us  with a change agenda      the orchestration of this divide between  us  and  them  also fur  ther points to the leadership need to manage the stress that comes with  being group deviants on the outside of society    while there are unique  positive advantages that come with being a leader and member of a vanguard facing social rejection  such as the added fuel for creativity it brings    as well as added group cohesion and respect for group leaders    leaders of vanguards still must provide any emotional and fi  nancial resources that are available to support their followers during spikes in social disapproval   while the present study primarily concentrated on vanguard group members for a group level review  there are other groups that are also worthy of study to gain a deeper understanding of vanguard leadership  for example  the  status quo  or society s elites    both of these terms are often employed in critical analyses of vanguards    but are often much less defined in other disciplines and empirical studies  while there is quite a bit of research on how elites and their organizations have responded to pressure from related groups  such as interest groups    it would aid our understanding of vanguard leadership to empirically test how and in what way elites are affected by specifically vanguard positioning and tactics  other groups of van  guard leadership research interest would be the mainstream media  political enemies    their base   meaning people who already support the vanguard s socio political positions but are not active members of the vanguard or politically mobilized yet       and the  masses  in general     mass societal level leadership theories and future directions  while a large amount of theoretical work has been done on van  guard leadership in critical  art  and philosophical studies    much less work has been done in other disciplines  particularly as it pertains to practice    the social movement lea  dership literature   arguably  one of the largest contributors to our understanding of vanguard leadership vis a vis social movement lea  dership     has had a tendency to focus more on constraints and other structural  rather than agentic  conditions    this approach has helped in our understanding of important social move  ment leadership phenomena such as the role of elites  history  and networks    all of which play a role in better understanding vanguard leadership  this emphasis towards structure  and away from agency  within the social movement literature however has resulted in  a scarcity of research into the way in which movement leaders function      if this is true of the social movement leadership literature in general  it is certainly true of the vanguard leadership literature  as noted be  fore  some studies  such as downton s rebel leadership    are   by the definitions we have provided in the present effort   studies of vanguard leadership  but these studies are few and far be  tween  even rarer are studies of social movement leadership that draw from more than one or two disciplines  with most reviews remaining within one body of knowledge   moving forward  it is clear that the investigation of vanguard lea  dership will have to be a multidisciplinary effort  in addition to critical theory  media studies  and political philosophy  disciplines such as so  ciology  psychology  political science  and cultural studies all offer important lenses in which to view vanguard leadership  for example  rucht   and yaziji and doh   both discuss the importance of leadership  identity  and ideology in the leadership of social move  ments  this has strong overlap with the political psychological literature    which also stresses the  r t  marcy the leadership quarterly             importance of identity in political ideology  and has further overlap with the general psychological literature on worldviews     an important leverage point for vanguard leaders  as world  views are what vanguard leaders are targeting and prompting to shift   research on the leadership of social change organizations   has suggested that prompting cognitive shifts is a key leadership practice  a practice that is supported by the use of key lea  dership cognitive skills  such as sensemaking and planning  found in the leader cognition literature on solving complex problems    which then brings us back again to the literature on vanguard leadership and the ways in which guy debord was a strategic thinker    all of these phenomena are important to integrate into a more holistic under  standing of vanguard leadership   conclusion  this article aimed to undertake a comprehensive review and theo  retical integration of relevant work related to the leadership of van  guard groups  in doing so  this article attempted to provide some de  finition towards the construct of socio political vanguard leadership  namely  leaders of groups that are somewhat autonomous from estab  lished political parties or social movements  and that are deliberately not a direct part of the political process  vanguard leaders work to in  fluence ideas and shift public consciousness in order to create the socio  political conditions for actors and groups to better effect political change  in this respect  vanguards are distinct from both social move  ments leaders as well as status quo political leaders  particularly in the lack of goals to become a part of mainstream decision making  the military applications of the term  vanguard  as being a separate  for  ward front also speaks to this idea of a vanguard being apart from the mainstream  in a socio political context  the vanguard is identified by the introduction of new beliefs and norms that directly challenge those of the wider society   the review of the literature on   social move  ment leaders  political leadership  and advocacy artist collectives highlight some particularly interesting gaps  the extant literature per  taining to avant gardes and or leadership within fringe socio political contexts is heavily grounded in critical theory and the study of social movements  these works have contributed greatly to our understanding of the context of socio political change  as well as the role that lea  dership can play in bringing this about  more work  however  on the practice of vanguard leadership would be advantageous to deepening our understanding of how particular leadership tactics influence and shape ideas within smaller collectives as well as larger societies  more specifically  this article identified that the goal of vanguard leaders   to shift the dominant worldview of public consciousness in order to allow space for later groups to further political agendas   is necessarily hostile towards established elites while at the same time not directly vying for elite power  attending to this goal thus invites strategies that are geared less towards collaboration and more towards agitation tactics  in ad  dition  socio political vanguard leaders attend to different specific goals at different levels of analysis  amongst others  the individual level re  quires leader cognitive skills related to creativity and social innovation  the group level requires the leadership skills to form  cohere  and guide a team  and the societal level requires the creation  implementation  and the hopeful adoption of a prescriptive mental model by the public through unconventional means   using historical examples of the futurist art movement of the early  s and the situationist international of the  s  this article ana  lyzes the goals and strategies of the vanguard leaders within these movements to illustrate parallels to the present day alt right move  ment in the west  in doing so  some future directions for research are suggested  first  the focus on the individual level of cognitive abilities of vanguard leaders  in line with the area of social innovation that is radical but non violent  and of leaders that seek to shape mainstream  worldviews but not takeover the existing reigns of political power  second  a deeper examination of the strategies employed to achieve the central goal of mindshare  and the intersection of new technologies with vanguard ideas  third  longer term inspection of the effects of different vanguard leaders on existing socio political beliefs and values  to trace the impact of vanguard ideas on mainstream culture  taken together  this article proposes that these insights offer a potentially rich area of future work within leadership studies   acknowledgements  i would like to thank

literature review  a b s t r a c t  we systematically review the recent impactful leadership succession literature in three types of organizations  contexts  namely publicly traded  privately owned    and political organizations  we compare and contrast these literatures  and argue that business and political leadership succession researchers and practitioners can learn from each other  the purpose of the review is fourfold  first  to take stock of the existing leadership succession research in these three related literatures   that examine the same essential phenomenon   but that have evolved separately  previous reviews have focused mostly on ceo succession   mainly in publicly traded firms  and to our knowledge no   comprehensive literature reviews on the important topics of privately owned and political organization leadership succession exist yet  second  to develop an overarching integrative conceptual framework   that structures the overall leadership succession literature and shows the potential areas of integration and difference among the three literatures  third  to develop three organizational frameworks   one for each organization type   that review what we know and what we should know about leadership succession in each type  fourth  to critically compare the icf  the three organizational frameworks  and the three literatures to better understand the similarities and differences among these literatures  by doing so and using a multidisciplinary approach we aim to contribute to the field in the following ways  firstly  we seek to synthesize the field of leadership suc  cession to identify important research questions that are ripe for study in the near future in the business and political science disciplines  secondly  we strive to uncover what succession researchers and practitioners across these disciplines may learn from each other   introduction  leadership succession is a potentially disruptive inevitable event  process that every organization faces    recently  organizations have been dealing with leadership successions more frequently    since top leaders  average tenure is shortening    while planned successions can lead to relatively smoother transitions and may have minimal or even positive impact on post succession performance  unplanned transitions can shake their organizations hard     various factors can influence an organization s leadership succes  sion  which in turn  may result in different outcomes  given the im  portance of the effects of leadership succession  ceo succession re  searchers have reviewed the literature almost decennially to  understand the phenomenon and the factors leading to positive and or negative ceo succession outcomes in order to advance research and practice on ceo succession  the three reviews on ceo succession done by kesner and sebora    giambatista et al     and berns and klarner   focused on the antecedents and consequences as well as the event and process of ceo succession  mainly in publicly traded firms  without distinguishing between successions in different types of organizations  these reviews enriched the field by highlighting some of the gaps  and suggesting interesting directions for future ceo succes  sion research  mainly in publicly traded firms  examining these reviews in chronological order  readers will notice that some suggested research in previous reviews has been acted upon in following years  a practice which informed the field considerably  while  we believe that ceo succession in publicly traded organizations still has some untapped research questions and venues  our paper has a different and broader    received   november    received in revised form   march    accepted   march    â corresponding author  e mail

   have some common as well as unique characteristics  to our knowledge  no study has attempted to build bridges among leadership successions in these three literatures  our interest in reviewing leadership succession in these literatures stems from our conviction that doing so can provide business and political succession researchers with opportunities to learn from each other  especially in the wake of some recent critical and unusual political and business leadership successions     fig    represents the overarching integrative conceptual framework   that we developed for leadership succession in different organi  zation types contexts  this icf shows    the leadership succession process  potential elements that are common similar in the three or  ganization types contexts   and    the characteristics of the three organization types contexts that can make aspects of this leadership succession process different in each organization types context    the leadership succession process box not only summarizes the current state of research on leadership succession  it also includes variables that have not been studied yet and that we consider to make important venues for future research   in the next sections of this paper we review the current state of leadership succession in each of the three organization types while  briefly comparing and contrasting them with each other  then we provide suggestions for future research for each organization type as well as suggestions for what each type may learn from the other types  finally  we conclude by further integrating the three literatures through additionally focusing on what business and political leadership suc  cessions may learn from this review and from each other and discussing the similarities and differences among these three literatures   to uncover what business and political succession analysts may learn from each other  we systematically review and organize the recent impactful leadership succession literature around categories and sub  categories of research questions that have been studied in the literature   and structure these categories subcategories under succession antecedents  succession event  characteristics  and theories  and  succession consequences  moreover  we identify important ques  tions that should be studied in the near future   for each of the three organization types  namely  publicly traded  privately owned  and political organizations     we do this for the following purposes  first  to take stock of the recent impactful leadership succession research in these three related literatures that have evolved separately  this is important  especially because previous reviews focused on ceo succession mainly in pub  licly traded firms and no   comprehensive reviews on the im  portant topics of privately owned and political organization leadership succession exist  second  to develop an icf for leadership succession in different organization types contexts that structures the three litera  tures around antecedents  event characteristics  and consequences and shows the potential areas of integration and difference among the three literatures    third  to develop three organizational frame  works   one for each organization type context   organized around research questions   and future directions      fourth  to critically compare the three literatures  organizational frameworks  and icf to better under  stand the similarities and differences among these literatures   publicly traded organization context

using a multidisciplinary approach  firstly  we seek to synthesize the field of leadership succession to identify critical research gaps and conceptual and empirical research questions that are ripe for study in the near future in the business and political science disciplines  sec  ondly  we strive to uncover what leadership succession researchers and practitioners across these disciplines may learn from each other   importance and scope of the study  this paper systematically reviews   as per the tranfield  denyer  and smart   guidelines   the state of the field of leadership suc  cession in publicly traded  privately owned  and political entities  three literatures that are related but that have evolved fairly separately  re  viewing these literatures on leadership succession is important and necessary for the following reasons     the number of studies on this phenomenon is growing because of the rise in leadership successions  ceo turnover rate of the world s   largest companies in   was       the highest rate in the past   years     and    the not so effective practice of replacement of leaders    moreover  this growing literature is addressing new research questions  examining new individual  group  and organizational state country level succession antecedents and consequences  and is analyzing suc  cession using new theoretical lenses and research methods due to the expanding diversity of the backgrounds and perspectives of the re  searchers studying succession    fur  ther  this body of succession literature is growing in complexity     we define leadership succession as the voluntary or involuntary replacement of the highest ranking person   in a publicly traded  privately owned  or political organization    a publicly traded organization   is a firm that has issued securities through an initial public offering   and is traded on at least one stock exchange or over the counter market    becoming a public firm allows the market to determine the value of the firm through daily trading    a privately owned family organization   is a firm owned by private investors or family members  thus  it does not need to meet the securities and exchange commission s   strict filing requirements for public firms in the u s  private firms may issue stock and have shareholders  but their shares do not trade on public exchanges and are not issued through an ipo  in general  the shares of these firms are less liquid and their values are difficult to determine    most pofos are family businesses  but some are owned by private equity firms  a political organization   is an institution or entity that is virtually owned funded by taxpayers society  that influences  creates  enforces  and or applies laws  mediates conflict  and or influences makes po  licies on the economy and social systems  examples of political orga  nizations include presidencies  federal and state governments  legis  latures  and judiciaries  public bureaucracies  political parties  etc     thus  in this review  leadership succession refers to ceo president succession in publicly traded and privately owned firms and to presidential  prime ministerial  and party leader succession  in political entities   kesner and sebora   and giambatista et al    reviewed the ceo succession literature  mainly in publicly traded organizations  up to    handler   and brockhaus   reviewed the ceo succession literature  in family businesses    up to    to our knowledge  no comprehen  sive literature review on leadership succession in political entities exists yet  thus  to review the breadth of the above three leadership succes  sion literatures with enough depth  relevance  currency  and  conciseness such that we can fit our review within the current space limits  we followed wowak  gomez mejia  and steinbach   and comprehensively reviewed the most recent research   in these three literatures published in impactful journals  defined as business and political science journals ranked in the top quartile  q   in scopus  journal rankings   to find articles relevant to our review of the three literatures we first used various combinations of keywords related to leader  succession and their synonyms  including ceo  president   prime minister   party  executive  family business  small business  en  trepreneur  founder  new leader ceo  etc  succession  transition  turn  over  replacement  selection  change  transfer  and so on  then we searched for relevant backward and forward citations of the articles we found in our keyword searches  following berns and klarner   we included articles on leader  succession and excluded articles marginally related to leader  succession  for example  articles that were about leader  in general but not about succession in parti  cular  about phenomena marginally related to leader  succession but not about the leader  succession phenomenon itself as the main phenomenon of interest  about executive   succession but not about the top leader s succession  and about aspects of political leadership elections that are not about political leader  succession were excluded  moreover  since the beginning  in our review of leadership succession in ptos we included only articles that used samples of ptos  in our review of leadership succession in pofos we included only articles that used samples of pofos  to avoid article duplication and keep the distinction between ptos and pofos clear  articles that explicitly used hybrid samples of ptos and pofos were neither included in our review of ptos nor included in our review of pofos  these articles are included in appendix a table a    fur  thermore  in our review of leadership succession in pos we included only articles that were about pos    however  we did not include articles that were about not for profit organizations     initially  we comprehensively reviewed summarized about   ar  ticles on leadership succession in ptos  about   in pofos  and about   in pos  that is  we summarized about   articles published in scopus indexed journals and coded them based on organization type  scopus journal quartile ranking    papers  methodology    data type    statistical analysis type    among others  when we applied the above inclusion exclusion criteria  the number of articles included in this review became   articles in total    we believe this is a more meritorious way to review the literature  as it includes better quality  more rigorous  and thus more impactful useful studies     to organize our review of the three literatures we borrowed from qualitative research methods  namely the multi order approach by gioia  corley  and hamilton    first order or subcategory themes represent the closest ideas to the articles  second order or category themes represent the grouping of the first order themes into broader topics  and third order or overall themes represent the grouping of the second order themes into bigger umbrella topics    in our review of the three literatures and their organizational fra  meworks   themes of research questions can be ranked from most important researched to least important researched  by mostly relying on the number of articles published on this subject  while some articles may cross the boundaries between first order  second order  and sometimes even third order themes  we chose to cite  list articles only under one category  to avoid double counting double citing articles  we cited listed each article under the theme subtheme that it was most relevant to and contributed to the most   b  farah  et al  the leadership quarterly             literature review  leadership succession in publicly traded organizations   what a firm becomes can be significantly influenced by how and to whom this  ceo s  power and authority are passed   this makes ceo succession a defining event for virtually every organization      since kesner and sebora   recognition of the impact of ceo succession on the fate of organizations  research on ceo succession has not slowed down  research after   has emphasized the antecedents  consequences  and the ceo succession event characteristics  albeit unequally  with more emphasis on antecedents  followed by con  sequences  and much less on the event and its characteristics   antecedents of leadership succession  leader attributes leader   characteristics and succession  since most researchers studying ceo succession believe leaders matter  it is not surprising to find many studies examining the relation between ceos  characteristics and ceos  promotion or dismissal  some of the characteristics that lead to executives  promotion to  or entrenchment in  the ceo position include executives  international experience    experience with more or less diverse boards prior to appointment    political connectedness especially in non state owned institutions    social capital gained across different business cycles contexts    and executives  overlapping experience  education with incumbent ceos    on the other hand  ceos with high or low levels of optimism are more likely to be forced out of their position than their counterparts with moderate optimism levels     leader   compensation and succession  since the  s  ceo compensation attracted attention from researchers and practitioners  especially in the absence of a significant link between executive compensation and firm performance    ceo succession researchers have also studied the impact of ceo compensation and its structure on ceo dismissal  ceo overpayment is not a predictor of ceo dismissal  especially that boards avoid dismissing ceos  unless ceos  overpayment is accompanied by serious underperformance    organizations with high levels of firm specific knowledge usually use restricted stocks in ceo compensation to discourage the departure of ceos with such knowledge and encourage them to stay and make long term investments    building on agency theory  inderst and mueller   theorize that linking ceos  compensation to firm performance plays a major role in incentivizing bad ceos to leave without severance agreements and in retaining good performing ceos  while ceo compensation got much attention in ptos  it got little attention in pofos and pos   leader   performance and succession  another leader related attribute that is studied in ptos more than in the other two types of organizations is leader performance  ceos who are bad bidders in cases of acquisitions    who file for financial restatements    or who issue inaccurate forecasts   are negatively evaluated by external analysts   and incur a higher likelihood of being dismissed from their ceo position   board attributes board characteristics and succession  boards of directors are major players in the governance of ptos  boards guard the interests of shareholders and are therefore the body responsible for monitoring the performance of ceos  more recently  they are becoming more active  in the ceo succession process  while  there is still much more to understand about board members  roles in ceo succession    their roles and incentive structures are even less studied in pofos and pos  in ptos  board members who do not actively seek enough information about external ceo candidates may suffer from information asymmetry  increasing the likelihood of ceo dismissal within a shorter period after appointment    larger boards  are more likely to dismiss a ceo based on his her poor performance    the boards are attracted to candidates who are close in age to the board s average age  however  this attraction disappears if the candidate has a prior poor performance record    board members  human and social capital have a positive impact on firm performance following a ceo succession    the more external managers serve on a supervisory board  the higher the likelihood of choosing an external ceo    however  the higher the external experience of the supervisory board members the higher the likelihood of choosing an internal ceo    in addition to the board composition  haleblian and rajagopalan   argue that the board s perception and attributions of the ceo s performance and efficacy affect their decision to dismiss the ceo   board compensation performance and succession  in addition to boards  active roles in monitoring sitting ceos  the structure of their incentives  that is increasing the equity based share in boards  incentives  increases boards  proactiveness in dismissing potentially poor performing ceos    citrin and ogden   find that board members should not be excluded when looking for a new ceo  especially given the combination of their inside knowledge of the organization and their outside perspective on operations   firm attributes firm characteristics risk performance and succession  while leaders  and boards  characteristics affect decisions related to ceo retention or dismissal  the idiosyncratic characteristics of the firm or the context of ceo succession also affect these decisions  firms  namely in the chinese context  rely on accounting performance measures rather than market or stock prices to decide on the performance of the firm  and on whether to retain or dismiss the ceo    some firms are more tempted to force ceos out than others  including firms with agency and information asymmetry problems    with control oriented cultures    and with high idiosyncratic or firm specific risks    other companies experience less forced ceo turnover  including companies that are diversified    and companies which value firm specific human capital such as service industries    the organization chart of a firm plays a role in ceo dismissal under low performance conditions  the presence of a separate coo or president position increases the chances of ceo dismissal when the firm is performing poorly    hence the presence of a fall back personality  may increase the chances of dismissing the leader of a poorly performing institution   environmental level antecedents  cultural  economic  political    or institutional attributes cultural and institutional attributes and succession  some factors outside the locus of control of the organization affect ceo succession and the performance of the organization  such factors include    industry and market conditions   and    country level characteristics such as the degree of managerial discretion and development of ceo labor markets    the structure of institutional shareholders    or shifts in the dominant institutional logic such as the rise in institutional ownership  in board involvement  or shareholder activism    banks also play monitoring roles and force poorly performing companies to undertake ceo turnover           et al      ozelge   saunders       event  characteristics  and theories of leadership succession  studying the antecedents and consequences of ceo succession gets more attention than studying the leadership succession event process and its characteristics   leadership succession event leader change  though  it has been established in the literature that leader change negatively affects firm performance  this negative relationship is more prevalent when the change in leader is accompanied by a change in leader gender be it female to male or vice versa    changing the leader in certain firms is forced  however  leaders who are politically connected and have structural and tenure power have a higher ability to avoid forced replacement    despite poor performance  nevertheless  the presence of inside directors with externally appreciated talents  may force the current ceo out of his her position  the main reason being these directors are able to serve immediately as insider ceo replacements or else the company risks losing them to competitors due to their needed talents    it is intriguing that this topic has been barely studied in pofos and pos   leadership succession characteristics internal external succession  the difference between internal and or external successors has been extensively studied in leader succession in publicly traded organizations  for example  what affects the board s decision to select an insider versus an outsider  tsoulouhas et al    argue that boards should select insiders versus outsiders based on superior capabilities  insiders are preferred to outsiders only if they have equal or better skills than outsiders  otherwise outsiders are preferred  however  boyer and ortiz molina   show empirically that boards may make their decisions based on stock ownership  executives with more stock ownership are more likely to be promoted to the ceo position  however  if inside executives do not own enough stocks  the board tends to hire an outsider ceo  when incoming ceos have a greater bargaining power they are more likely to have duality    especially when outgoing ceos are fired  or were externally hired  or insiders promoted from the coo or president positions    investors  perceptions of inside successors and outside successors depends on the reason for ceo succession  following an integrity or competence failure  investors  have a better perception of the firm if the successor is an outsider    outside successors perform well when they resemble the incumbent ceo socio  demographically and have prior successful experience    or when the firm has been performing poorly under the previous ceo     planned unplanned succession  the use of interim ceos has gained traction in practice   and in ceo succession research is an interesting event especially in the case of unplanned exit of incumbents  liang et al    propose a theoretical framework arguing about who is more likely to be an interim ceo and under which conditions  they argue interim ceos who perform well in the transition period enjoy longer interim tenure and are more likely to get promoted to ceo  using an interim ceo hurts firm performance unless the interim ceo serves simultaneously as the chairperson    and boards usually choose to appoint interim leaders when the sitting ceo got fired and there is no known successor    interim ceos are more likely to use earnings management   to boost firm performance especially in the absence of effective governance mechanisms     consequences of leadership succession  leader attributes succession and leader behavior compensation  leaders  attributes have been studied more as antecedents rather than as consequences of succession  though we believe that such an event can have an impact on the leader and that this impact might affect the way the leader conducts himself herself during ceo tenure  ceos  more so outside ceos  increase discretionary spending during their first year of tenure even if the firm s risk exposure is high    boards need to be attentive to the severance agreement offered to ceos stepping down voluntarily as markets react negatively when these ceos receive high payments     board attributes succession and board behavior  similar to leaders  attributes  boards  attributes have also been more studied pre rather than post succession  boards increase their monitoring activities of the newly appointed ceo the first year and then their monitoring intensity decreases  hence sometimes justifying the weak link between poor performance and ceo turnover     firm attributes succession and firm characteristics  unlike leaders  and boards  attributes  the impact of ceo succession on firm attributes  namely performance  has garnered a significant amount of research  cao et al    argue ceo turnover negatively affects exploration and exploitation capabilities of the firm  unless the successor is at least as embedded as the predecessor in the firm s intrafirm and interfirm social networks  making the successor s choice an important task to minimize the effect of ceo turnover on firm capabilities   succession and firm performance  firm performance captured the lion s share of ceo succession  it has served as the dependent variable in multiple studies  earlier than    the impact of the origin of the successor  insider versus outsider  on post succession firm performance has been extensively studied    ceo succession negatively impacts performance and increases the volatility of a firm s stock price    karaevli   finds that the impact of ceo origin on firm performance is moderated by environmental munificence  prior firm performance  and changes in the top management team members  in their meta analysis  schepker et al    find that    ceo succession negatively impacts short term firm performance but has no significant direct impact on long term performance     ceo origin plays a role in mediating the relationship between ceo succession and long term performance  and    inside ceos do not engage in drastic strategic change but they improve long  term firm performance   having a succession plan in place reduces the negative impact of ceo succession on firm performance    performance of firms with a majority controlling shareholder improves significantly after the replacement of the ceo    since the ma  jority shareholder is actively involved in monitoring the performance of the ceo to save its own interests in the firm  also  a firm s performance is contingent on the sensemaking and sensegiving cues released to the public post ceo replacement    hence firm narratives play a major role in post succession performance   hiring previous ceos is negatively linked to post succession firm performance    so is hiring successors with different power levels than the predecessor    however  prior experience as ceo with turnaround capabilities and the degree of fit of the successor to the succession s contextual conditions at hand positively affect post succession firm performance    ceo succession affects different sta  keholders differently  for example  generally bondholders  value de  creases while stockholders  value increases post ceo succession             mansi      therefore when looking at the impact of ceo succes  sion on firm performance one should pay attention to different stake  holders rather than all stakeholders together  also governing bodies need to pay attention to the characteristics of the successor  because insiders and outsiders access different kinds of resources    recently  researchers have been investigating the impact of ceo succession not only on financial and market performance but also on corporate sustainability performance  bernard et al    use upper echelon and agency theories to show that ceo turnover has a positive impact on a firm s corporate social performance  this positive impact is higher when the ceo is recruited from outside the firm   succession and strategic change  the ability of successors to induce strategic change has also drawn the attention of strategy and organization scholars  some researchers believe that the ability of inside successors to induce strategic change after they become ceos is usually limited because they are trained by previous ceos    while others show that outsiders are more likely to induce strategic change including the degree of firm internationalization    thus  the origin of the ceo affects the strategic change undertaken post succession  inside ceos usually are more interested in achieving a greater scale of divestiture whereas outside ceos are interested in increasing the scope of change through divestiture    karaevli and zajac   hypothesize the nature of the succession  the predecessor s tenure  and prior firm performance moderates the impact of outside ceos on strategic change  these authors show that if succession is not forced or pre succession firm performance increases  the outside origin of the new ceo is positively associated with post succession strategic change  however  the moderating effect of the predecessor s tenure is not significant  despite this debate  in a recent study  elosge et al    do not find support to most of their hypotheses regarding the impact of insider or outsider origin of the ceo and its impact on strategic change measured through the firm s degree of internationalization   literature review  leadership succession in privately owned   businesses   family firms combine all the tensions of family life with all the strains of business life  and at no moment do both sorts of stress combine so forcefully as at that of generational change      our literature review of leadership succession in privately owned  family organizations revealed that most pofos were family firms and almost all research on leadership succession in pofos concerned family businesses  thus  we will use the terms  pofos  and  family busi  nesses firms  interchangeably hereafter   although we found more recent impactful studies on leadership succession in ptos than pofos    leadership succession in pofos may be more crucial to the survival and continuity of these organizations than to their publicly  traded counterparts  we argue this since fewer than    of family businesses are passed on to the second generation whereas only    make it to the third generation    thus  in this section we review the literature on the essential topic of leadership succession in privately owned family businesses    to review this literature  we organize it into three overall themes and their re  spective category and subcategory themes that emerged during our review     antecedents of leadership succession  leader attributes successor characteristics and succession  salvato et al    found that the selection of ceos and their career patterns in family firms were driven more by the managerial skills they developed over their careers than by family related issues  suggesting managerial proficiency  overcame nepotism in family firm ceo selections  dalpiaz et al    developed a framework for understanding family business succession narratives and presented a typology of some of the narrative strategies   that successors may use to legitimize their successions  denoble et al    pinpointed key social capital  e g  family relationships with    incumbent ceo     family members involved in the family owned business    and    family members not involved in the fob  external and internal business relationships  and human capital  e g  tacit firm specific knowledge  industry knowledge  and general business knowledge  dimensions that could be utilized to develop a family business self efficacy scale that could be used to identify and or develop potential successful family successors   successors  gender and succession  gender and succession has been limitedly studied in all three literatures  given that in family firms  passing the baton to women family members is becoming more common  this topic has been somewhat more studied in pofos than ptos and pos  vera and dean   found daughter successors in family firms faced challenges such as employee rivalry  work life balance  and greater uncertainty about whether they would one day be the successor  they also found daughters experienced more difficulties succeeding their mothers than succeeding their fathers  haberman and danes   found women in father son firms suffered from feelings of exclusion and instances of higher disagreement among family members  which created less shared meaning  and lower levels of integration among family members  women in father daughter firms enjoyed feelings of inclusion  resulting in lower disagreement that produced higher levels of shared meaning  collaboration  and integration among family members   firm attributes firm performance and succession  although organizational performance and succession has been well studied in both ptos and pofos  it has been limitedly studied in pos  hillier and mccolgan   found that family ceos were less likely than non family ceos to depart their positions following poor performance  due to weak internal governance systems in family firms  however  andrÃ©   criticized hillier and mccolgan s   work and suggested it had a number of issues   related to performance measurement  sample selection  firm size and age  industry  etc    that required further examination  tsai et al    found a negative relationship between diversification level and ceo turnover in family firms  which they attributed to family ceos entrenching themselves in their family firms   event  characteristics  and theories of leadership succession  leadership succession characteristics intra family succession   and extra family succession    this topic has been extensively studied in pofos  internal versus external successions have also been fairly well studied in ptos  however  similar topics   have not been studied in pos  almost all articles in this category discussed either intra  family succession   alone or ifs versus extra family succession    for instance  among the studies that discussed ifs  de massis et al    showed that incumbents  attitudes towards ifss are influenced by both situational   and individual   antecedents as well as by their interactions  moreover  lambrecht   showed that ifs is a lifelong  continuous process  in which the family must cultivate the soft elements of the succession process    further  a family business can develop into a family dynasty only when it embraces sound governance as a  b  farah  et al  the leadership quarterly             fundamental principle    in addition  lam   highlighted the inconsistencies between the expressed attitudes  perceptions  plans  and actual behaviors of family firm members during the succession process and attributed these inconsistencies to the multi entity roles family firm members simultaneously play during this interactive  dynamic social process  furthermore  mcmullen and warnick   theoretically argued that the more a parent founder promotes affective commitment to the family business in a child  successor  by supporting his her psychological needs for competence  autonomy  and relatedness within the family business  the greater the likelihood the child successor will continue to engage in family business activities  conversely  de massis et al    analyzed the literature on family business succession and presented a long list of individual  relational  financial  contextual  and process factors that prevent ifs from occurring  salvato and corbetta   analyzed the detailed descriptions of four advisor directed leadership development processes in generational family businesses  they found that  by taking on a transitional leadership role shared with the incumbent and the successor  advisors can play a key role in facilitating the construction of successors  leadership   among the studies that discussed ifs versus efs  royer et al    found that specific   knowledge characteristics   combined with a favorable transaction atmosphere  made ifs preferable over efs  furthermore  jaskiewicz et al    identified four approaches   of managing potentially conflicting family and commercial logics that are related to four succession pro  cesses   and that lead to ifs or efs  in addition  liu et al    found that even when a leader can overcome individual decision biases  a sampling bias resulting from families  strong ties can still allow a leader to wrongly conclude that ifs is better than efs when the opposite is true     planned unplanned succession    this subcategory included several articles that discussed ceo succession planning  motwani et al    found that    firms with less than us  m in revenues placed a higher priority on selecting a successor with strong sales marketing skills  presumably to achieve business growth and    it was important for all smes to develop a formal succession plan  communicate their successor s identity  and provide training  mentoring to the incumbent ceo  tatoglu et al    found predecessors  perceptions about the extent of succession planning was related to their desire to relinquish power  gilding et al     suggested that the family firm succession planning literature assumes incumbents have two main motives  family firm continuity and family harmony  by cross tabulating these motives they produced a typology of four distinct combinations of motives for succession planning  they then argued these combinations of motives suggest four succession planning outcomes  institutionalization  implosion  imposition  and individualization   marshall et al    found that    older owner age was  para  doxically  directly related to formal succession plans and indirectly related to behavioral practices that interfere with succession planning and    both autocratic and relational leadership are positively asso  ciated with the importance of succession planning  eddleston et al    found that the extent to which strategic planning and succession planning are related to family firm growth depends on the generation managing the firm  both forms of planning positively affect first gen  eration  but not second generation  firms  growth  succession planning and strategic planning respectively positively and negatively affect third and beyond generation firms  growth  gagnÃ¨ et al    studied the effects of the goal adjustment capacities   of family business leaders nearing retirement age  on their retirement planning  they found that leaders with high goal reengagement capacities who trusted their successor s abilities set an earlier retirement date than others and that leaders with poor goal disengagement capacities who did not trust their successor were unable to improve their retirement expectations over time   leadership succession theories theories explaining family business leadership succession  theory papers attempting to broadly explain the leadership succession phenomenon in general were found for pofos but not for ptos or pos  this category included mostly theory papers attempting to explain family firm succession or transgenerational entrepreneurship  janjuha jivraj and spence   proposed a new development of reciprocity theory called bounded intergenerational reciprocity and used it as a framework to explain the dynamics of intergenerational family firm succession  blumentritt et al    introduced game theory as a model for analyzing family firm succession  they defined game theory as a set of rational but interdependent choices made by individuals about leadership  yan and sorenson   conceptually examined confucian values and their effect on family firm succession  jaskiewicz et al    built a new theory  based on what they called entrepreneurial legacy  to explain how exceptional firms achieve transgenerational entrepreneurship   consequences of leadership succession  leader attributes succession and leader characteristics  brun de pontet et al    found that although control stayed largely with incumbents in family firms approaching succession  indicators of succession readiness were more related to successors  levels of control  cadieux   presented a typology of predecessor roles during and after instatement of the successor and found that predecessors played teaching  protector  introducer  mobilizer  intermediary  and confidante roles during this period   firm attributes succession and firm characteristics risk  fan et al    found that privately owned firms move from an insider  to a more outsider  based accounting system around a succession  due to predecessors  personalized assets    that facilitated relationship contracting  but that are nontransferable to successors  additionally  molly et al    found that first generation family ceo successions negatively impacted family firms  debt rates and growth rates but did not impact their profitability  however  later generation family ceo successions positively impacted family firms  debt rates but did not impact their growth rates or profitability  amore et al    found that the appointment of non family professional ceos significantly increased the use of debt   succession and firm performance longevity  succession and organizational performance has been extensively studied in ptos and pofos  however it has been barely studied  if at all  in pos  this category in the research on pofos included several articles discussing the relation between succession and different measures of firm performance  pÃ©rez gonzÃ¡lez    bennedsen et al     and cucculelli and micucci   found that family ceo successions  as compared to non family professional ceo successions  had a negative impact on family firm performance  chittoor and das   found that non family ceo successions    compared to family ceo successions  had a positive impact on family firm performance   diwisch et al    did not find a relation between planned   successions  versus no planned   successions  and family firm growth  but found a positive relation between   successions and family firm growth  cabrera suarez   found that the quality  b  farah  et al  the leadership quarterly             of interpersonal relationships  successors  expectations  and the role of the predecessor differentiated between more and less successful suc  cession processes  pan et al    found that family firms used more corporate philanthropy in connection to family   ceo successions  especially when the succession was a first generation ceo succession  suggesting it reduces the magnitude of poor performance after family ceo successions   two articles studied the determinants of family firm longevity  the first found older firms    used participatory decision making     held family meetings  and    had formal redemption and liquidity plans    the second analyzed and dis  cussed in some detail the differential effects of inheritance law provi  sions on family firm succession and longevity in germany  france  hong kong  and the united states     successor characteristics and firm performance  in this category  venter et al    found that the willingness of the successor to take over  and the relationship between the owner manager and successor positively influenced both the satisfaction with the succession process and the continued profitability of the family firm  they also found that the preparation level of the successor positively impacted only the continued profitability of the family firm  cater iii et al    found the dynamics of successor teams may lead  either to a positive outcome track resulting in team commitment and thus the continuity of the family firm  or to a negative outcome track leading to the dissolution of the team and potentially the family firm  sharma and irving   theoretically proposed four bases of successor commitment to family firms   affective  normative  calculative  and imperative   and argued that these different bases of commitment lead to varying levels of discretionary behaviors and thus of family firm performance  sardeshmukh and corbett   found that successors who balance and combine their family firm specific human capital  built through experience within the family firm  with general human capital  built through education and work experience outside the family firm  better perceive entrepreneurial opportunities   literature review  leadership succession in political organizations   the king is dead  long live the king     in the field of political science  much attention is paid to how in   cumbent politicians hold on to power and  when necessary  how they are replaced  this interest certainly is merited  for as bueno de mesquita and smith   note   political succession  or rather its avoidance  is at the heart of the decisions leaders make   to focus this inquiry we use bynander and t hart s   approach  bynander and t hart   view leader succession in politics as change in the occu  pation of senior positions within political parties in or out of govern  ment  the most conspicuous and consequential of which are those of heads of government and party leaders  because change in senior po  litical positions often accompanies   a change in the entire personnel exercising the powers of government owing to pre  dictable political events such as elections    there is a slippery definitional  slope  with which analysts must contend  are all democratic elections really about succession  in one sense  they are  as every vote carries with it the chance to reaffirm the existing leader  or choose a new one  yet democratic elections ac  complish several discrete functions  such as determining public opinion on policy issues  recruiting new representatives  mobilizing followers  collecting financial resources  and so on  in analyzing such complexity  scholars focus on a variety of salient factors and questions  and so a relatively large literature on elections is published annually  for our purposes  only studies of elections as they pertain directly to succession   defined as change in the head of government or party leader office   are salient to this study   normally  democratic and non democratic systems are dis  tinguished when analyzing political phenomena across nation states   owing to democracy s large effect on key processes  there are several different approaches to discern the level of democracy  a widely used and reliable method to determine a system s democratic status is to consult freedom house s  country scores  ranking    which distinguishes free countries from those that are partly free and not free  we use this method here to refine our study of succession in the political sphere   while this analysis compares the business and political science lit  eratures on leadership succession  it s worth noting the two spheres are distinct in several respects  modern democratic voting processes have few obvious analogs in the business world  for example  among pub  licly traded firms it is difficult to locate organizations where all the employees regularly cast an equal vote to decide upon a new ceo   as citizens do in elections   our search for recent impactful journal articles on leadership suc  cession returned   results published in political science  the initial data collection was reviewed carefully  and some articles whose content did not reflect our inquiry were removed  a total of   articles met the criteria for analysis  these articles were allocated among three cate  gories that reflected whether each concerned a system that was fully democratic    not fully democratic    or that re  ferenced both types      to refine our understanding of each study s main goal  we induced sub  categories based on each article s core research question   the main categories and sub categories help to organize our inquiry  their spe  cific contents are discussed in more detail below  and are summarized in table     democratic systems  individual level antecedents  leader attributes leader power and succession  one of the three thematic categories comprises studies of democratic systems  of the   research papers under scrutiny here  nineteen of these are about leadership succession within democratic systems  within this theme  a first sub category of analysis concerns leader power and succession  the study of power lies at the heart of political science  so it is a little surprising that only one of the nineteen democratic succession articles directly focuses on this subject  bennister et al    conceived of leaders  political authority as a kind of capital  they present a leadership capital index   that can be used to track and compare the fortunes of political leaders  exploring its utility in analyzing incumbent resiliency in the specific case of former british prime minister tony blair  the authors concluded  the lci has the potential to provide a rich  nuanced  comparative and diachronic analysis of political leadership  owing to its focus on relational linkages to supporters and allies     group organizational level antecedents  elite party parliament government attributes democratic elite bargaining and succession  another sub category of studies examines how elite relationships  perceptions  shared preferences  and exchanges within party structures influence who is chosen  and how they are chosen  to lead  this group of studies includes six analyses by o brien    greene and haber    ennser  jedenastik and mÃ¼ller    malamud    horiuchi et al     and bolleyer and bytzek    scholars here aimed to move beyond institutional settings of leadership selection or situational influences such as economic conditions to explain succession  horiuchi et al     for example  proposed a perceptual theory of leadership survival that focuses on the expectations of party constituents who have the power to remove leaders  they surmised that because constituents remember political stances and recall efficacy  some predecessors are much  harder acts to follow  than others  consequently  they show that these perceptions explain differential leader survival rates regardless of the extant rules concerning leader removal and replacement  o brien   showed gendered political  b  farah  et al  the leadership quarterly             opportunity structures are shaped by parties  political performance  namely  women are more likely to retain office when parties gain seats  but more likely to lose office when performance begins to erode   in a similar vein  greene and haber   developed and tested a theory of intraparty preferences and leader selection predicated on the hypothesis that a party s electoral context influences its preference di  versity  sensitive to perceptions of environmental conditions like health of the economy  they showed intraparty heterogeneity likely influences the amount of  cohesion between the party s leaders and their ability to negotiate with potential coalition partners or on policy agreements     ennser jedenastik and mÃ¼ller   claimed that organizational and behavioral characteristics of the lea  dership selection and removal process impact the odds of party leader change  exploring their hypotheses in a study of austrian parties  they found electoral success and institutional intra party factors to be the most significant determinants of party leader survival  malamud   proposed that the argentine collapse of   featuring the resignation of two presidents was in fact heavily guided by an identifiable set of sub national executives   mainly peronist party mayors and governors   whose resiliency ensured an unappreciated continuity in that period s apparently chaotic politics  finally  bolleyer and bytzek   showed that party organizational characteristics   influenced party capacity to sus  tain electoral support after breakthrough   environmental level antecedents  cultural  economic  political    or institutional attributes democratic rules and succession  of the nineteen studies of succession in democratic systems  the largest category of attention concerned  democratic rules and succession   institutional analysis is a traditional method of examining leadership processes  focusing on the formal and informal rules of selection  our collection reflects this approach  one well established approach to studying political succession is to focus on who chooses the leader  a group of individuals known as the selectorate  in our collection analysts such as kenig    cross and blais    wauters    faucher    and matthews   study the democratization of leadership selection rules  particularly concerning the  widening  of the selectorate to include grass roots members in what some define as a  participatory revolution     of these the most impactful assessments are found by kenig   who offered a more complex method of classifying key aspects of leadership selection  and who in another study found wider selectorates do produce a wider field of contestants  albeit along with less competitive contests    adopting a slightly different tack by examining candidate selection rules at multiple levels of politics  barnea and rahat   showed that the frequency of reform in candidate selection methods increases when external and internal environments are more competitive   a longstanding method of studying succession rules in politics is to focus on legal and constitutional rules overarching leader selection  authors of three papers adopt this method to probe the constitutional and legal adequacy of american executive succession procedures in the context of a   fordham law school symposium  treanor s in  troductory essay noted the rules governing succession have evolved considerably over the last two centuries  however  there are still a number of critical gaps in the law  and the  potential for disaster re  mains real     baker and fitzpatrick   then reviewed several problematic scenarios concerning executive succes  sion drawn from political drama and presidential history to underscore that power transfer should be seamless when the american president is incapacitated or absent  analyzing the presidential succession act of    fleming   suggested three minor changes to it that would ensure succession protocols access persons with considerable executive experience while ensuring the principle of legislative succession re  mains intact   group organizational level consequences  elite party parliament  government attributes succession and electoral consequences  in the final sub category of democratic studies  a couple of scholars consider how leadership change may influence voters  lehrer   investigated the relationship between the kinds of people who control party leadership selection and the party s responsiveness to voters  he finds that intra party institutions   are decisive with respect to which groups the party  enfranchises in the leadership selection    in a similar vein  somer topcu    using data from seven western european democracies  showed that leadership change reduced voter disagreement about party policy positions   non democratic systems  group organizational level antecedents  elite party parliament government attributes non democratic elite bargaining and succession  our search located   articles concerning political succession in non democratic systems  it may seem unusual that there is more attention to non democratic systems than democratic ones  however  because elite control is at the heart of non democratic governance  and because effecting a peaceful transfer of power in autocracies is often difficult  the weight of analysis in this field tends to focus heavily on how small  highly privileged ruling groups retain power  the topics of democratic and non  democratic elite bargaining and succession have been extensively studied in pos  however  their counterparts  e g  board and tmt negotiations and succession  have been rarely studied in ptos and pofos  probably because these negotiations happen privately behind closed doors   in view of the above  a large category of articles concerns the me  chanics and dynamics of inter elite bargaining and succession  among these are magaloni s   widely cited study of credible power sharing arrangements under autocracy  hale s   analysis of elite collective action and regime cycles  and hoffmann s   study of cuba s post fidel castro succession  within this theme a few scholars focus on familial power transfer  such as brownlee s   study of hereditary succession in modern autocracies  and kokkonen and sundell s   treatment of the virtues of primogeniture  that is  the right of succession belonging to first born children  mostly first born sons  in ensuring autocratic stability   some analysts studied elite bargaining and succession events in light of progress towards democratization  donno    for example  found that the effect of internal and international pressure on democratization is contingent on the type of authoritarian regime   and that the greater susceptibility to pressure explains why competitive authoritarian elections are more likely to lead to democ  racy  with a similar view towards explaining the effect of civil society along with external western elites on joyce banda s rise to power in malawi  gabay   underscored domestic and global political economy as key drivers in malawi s postcolonial era   as well  we located several case studies of inter elite bargaining concerning succession in countries such as iran  russia  and azerbaijan  thoughtfully evaluating several scenarios concerning the exit of ayatollah khamenei  jones   concluded that  the suc  cession process   will be a high stakes and brutal showdown condi  tioned more by the politics of the moment than by the provisions of the constitution   blank   similarly investigated succession in post  soviet russia from the perspective of tsarist patrimony  concluding the state s foundations are inherently unstable  with respect to azerbaijan  radnitz   traced the efforts of president heydar aliyev in mana  ging internal conflict and passing the post to his son  concluding that scholars of post soviet politics err when they take the unitary state for granted  herron   and stacher   examined authoritarian elections to uncover how they ensure a ruling regime s dominance and  b  farah  et al  the leadership quarterly             pre empt opposition challenges   environmental level antecedents  cultural  economic  political    or institutional attributes non democratic institutions and succession  the effects of democratic and non democratic external factors   on succession have been extensively studied in pos  the impact of such external factors on succession has also been fairly well studied in ptos but not pofos  in examining how scholars are studying leadership succession in non democratic systems  we discerned another category of articles sharing an institutional focus  in an important analysis  gandhi and przeworski   found authoritarian rulers rely on nominally democratic institutions for political survival when they need to solicit the cooperation of outsiders or deter the threat of rebellion  similarly  frantz and stein   found that succession rules  like other pseudo democratic institutions  provide survival benefits for dictators because they reduce the incentives supporting a  coup  or a forceful grab for power  zeng   found that institutionalized party rules that have developed over a long period are key to understanding what matters most in the selection of china s leaders  cheeseman   argued open seat polls   are especially likely to produce opposition victories in sub saharan africa  and so work towards democratic progress  finally  nalepa and powell   found that under a weak international criminal court   regime  the more the opposition had engaged in criminal forms of dissidence  the more likely was the dictator to peacefully relinquish power  if the icc is strong  the degree of the opposition s engagement in criminal forms of dissidence mostly has no effect on the dictator s likelihood of exiting   event  characteristics  and theories of leadership succession regular and irregular succession  observing that non democratic successions often hinge on the fates of

worldwide and succession  the final group of articles examined succession across mixed systems  i e   democratic and non democratic systems  the current subcategory includes a single paper examining women s worldwide political leadership by jalalzai and krook    in considering what factors explain the increased election of women within some states but not others  the authors examined both executive and legislative participation rates to conclude that gendered power dynamics are still very much at work in the political sphere  they noted the enduring natures of elite discrimination against women and other non dominant groups  finding that some key  demand side factors  explain why policies such as party gender quotas have been unevenly successful across states   group organization level antecedents  elite party parliament government attributes presidential systems and succession  three articles concerned the relation between presidential systems and succession  marsteintredet and berntzen   engaged linz s astute observation that presidentialism is a rigid regime which creates political conflict that can overwhelm it  they found the pattern of presidential interruptions over the last   years suggested latin american presidentialism is no longer marked by rigidity and reduced democratic legitimacy  in a conceptual follow up study  marsteintredet   presented a typology of crises and presidential interruptions to help compare cases of executive instability  examining presidents who face term limits  baturo   showed it is the magnitude of political spoils along with the probability of retaining them that lures presidents to try to overstay their limited tenure   environmental level antecedents  cultural  economic  political    or institutional attributes incentive structures  rents  and succession  another research question asks  what sorts of incentives influence succession in mixed systems  konrad and skaperdas   presented a game theoretic treatment demonstrating in the abstract that allowing individuals to compete to succeed a leader  while retaining key assets such as life and property in the event of a loss  is optimal for the leader  more recently  debs   argued military dictators are more likely to transition quickly to democracy than other kinds of dictators because they expect democratic successors to use less violence and thus expect a large improvement in their post tenure fate   environmental level consequences  cultural  economic  political    or institutional attributes succession and incentive structures and rents  konrad and mui   in another game theoretic treatment analyzed the benefits that may accrue when leaders appoint successors  they found that appointing a successor may make a coup more attractive for the successor and less attractive for the other members of the elite  they also determined conditions when the overall effect of appointing a successor benefits the leader and enables him to acquire a larger share of the governance rent in equilibrium  in the next three sections we turn to discuss future directions for leadership succession in publicly traded  privately  owned  and political organizations   future directions for leadership succession in publicly traded  privately owned  and political organizations  this section discusses important future research questions direc  tions that we believe are critical to better understand and move forward the field of leadership succession in ptos  pofos  and pos in the near future  these future directions emerged either from our literature re  view of leadership succession in each of the three literatures or from comparing each one of these literatures with its counterparts to identify areas in which researchers in these literatures can learn from or provide insights to their counterparts in the other literatures  while some of the gaps among the three literatures are detectable by comparing tables       and    and looking at table    in this section we focus on what we consider the most important and impactful topics for evolving the field and driving it forward in the near future based on what we uncovered in our literature review   leadership succession and organizational performance outcomes  our review of the literature on leadership succession in ptos shows the relationship between leadership succession and organizational outcomes  especially organizational performance  as the area that draws the most attention  perhaps due to its importance to practi  tioners  most studies on leadership succession in ptos used financial measures  such as roa  to account for organizational performance  very few studies on leadership succession in ptos used the other measures suggested by rowe and morrow jr     particularly cor  porate social responsibility  in our set of papers on leadership succes  sion in ptos  only bernard et al    considered corporate social performance  given the gradual shift in strategy towards the triple bottom line      we believe it is time for leadership succession researchers of ptos and the other two types of organizations to start studying the impact of leadership succession on performance measures other than financial performance  recently some firms that ignored their social responsibilities have suf  fered multiple leader successions in very short time periods  examples include  but are not limited to  wells fargo    volkswagen    and british petroleum     an important research question  both theoretically and empirically  then becomes whether a leader should be fired immediately following a scandal despite an organization s successful financial economic per  formance  if so  should organizations promote internally  hire ex  ternally  or appoint an interim leader until they find the  right  chief  there is a wealth of research on this area in ptos but not as much in pofos or pos  probably because unplanned successions are less fre  quent and successors are generally more known in advance in these two other types of organizations   we also believe using different performance measures may be of importance to the political succession literature  using developing  people and or planet  performance measures   such as gross national happiness     among others   in addition to measures such as deficits surpluses and or debt to gdp   may be inter  esting for the political science field in general and the political lea  dership succession sub field in particular  a similar question could be asked in the political arena  following a scandal should the leader re  sign immediately  if so  should the vice leader be promoted or should a search for an outsider be undertaken  or a neutral custodian be ap  pointed until a new leader emerges  some countries have clearer emergency succession processes than others  it would be interesting to compare the outcomes of such emergency successions between coun  tries with clearer emergency succession processes and countries with no such clear processes  this research could help political entities avoid chaos when scandals occur  while studying the impact of scandals on succession   is an important venue for all organizations  understanding what led to an organization s corporate  b  farah  et al  the leadership quarterly             social irresponsibility  e g   the leader s characteristics or compensation package composition  social and political embeddedness  among others may be highly informative in vetting new candidates for leadership positions   leader characteristics are not the only factors that affect post suc  cession performance  bilgili et al    find that organizations play a role in improving post succession performance by influencing the per  ceptions of shareholders of the firm undergoing succession through organizational narratives  while this is an important finding for ptos  it can also be interesting for pofos and pos  it is interesting to theore  tically find the components of a political speech post succession that can unite voters constituents around the elected appointed leader  it is also interesting to empirically compare winning speeches and dissect their components and study their impact on the degree of unity of the members of pos  we believe this can have an important impact on the practice of political leadership succession   another organizational outcome of interest for ptos is strategic change  previously  researchers tended to believe that insiders are trained by their predecessors and hence are psychologically and cog  nitively attached to the current strategy of the firm and so may not induce strategic change    more recent studies take into consideration additional factors that may affect new ceos  abilities to induce change such as their origin  insiders versus outsiders  their alignment with their predecessors  thinking  and whether the predecessor departs the firm or is retained as board chair after suc  cession occurs    yet still much remains unanswered  despite the multiple calls to use qualitative methods in ceo succession studies    there is a dearth of qualitative studies in ptos  qualitative studies are very common in pos  and are becoming more accepted and valued in the strategy field    it might be the right time for business leadership succession researchers to use qualitative research to com  plement findings from quantitative research    zhang and rajagopalan   called for qualitative and survey studies to help better understand the differences in the change dynamics be  tween outside and inside ceos  qualitative studies may also be more suited to assess whether a strategic change is in the mandate of the ceo  given that inside ceos are usually promoted in successful orga  nizations and boards are generally not in favor of major strategic changes in such cases  whereas outside ceos are usually recruited with the mandate to induce important strategic changes  we believe that this would affect the interpretation of results if we only look at publicly available data  we think taking into consideration qualitative studies that help us comprehend the new ceo s mandate would help re  searchers and practitioners better understand the factors that drive strategic change   while the field of political science may enrich the methodology of the ptos  succession field  we believe borrowing the concept of stra  tegic change may enrich political succession studies  similar to ques  tions raised for ptos  political science researchers can ask whether just a change in the political mindset of the new leader  from liberal to conservative or vice versa    should lead to a strategic change in a government s direction even if the government did well under the previous leader  or whether change should affect only certain areas but not others  to achieve this  strategic change should be conceptualized and measured at the country or party level then pos  researchers can collect data at the country or party level following several successions that took place   one obvious difference we noticed in comparing the research on leadership succession and performance in the three literatures is the minimal concern political scientists devote to the relationship between successor characteristics and performance  the ceo succession litera  ture in business is well stocked with examinations comparing whether  insider  candidates who become leaders outperform  outsider   candidates  as well  other kinds of characteristics  such as gender  are considered when assessing the organizational impact of leader choice in business organizations whether ptos or pofos  however  our collec  tion of political analyses leaves the question of how leader character  istics may influence key performance outcomes  such as party cohesion  candidate recruitment  or voter perception  largely unaddressed  which characteristics are more important for political leaders and why    how does leader succession influence political performance  while a few analysts engage in such questions  like bolleyer and bytzek    along with ennser jedenastik and mÃ¼ller    these questions merit much more focus   our review of the literature on performance before and after lea  dership succession in pofos showed the following  first  our review identified only four recent impactful articles studying the important effect of family firm performance on leadership succession in pofos    hillier and mccolgan   showed that family ceos were less likely than non family ceos to depart their positions fol  lowing poor family firm performance  however  andrÃ©   criti  cized hillier and mccolgan s   study suggesting it had several issues  such as performance measurement and sample selection among others and thus arguing this relationship required further investigation  given the important research and practical implications of such a re  lationship  we believe more research needs to be done on this important relationship to have more evidence either supporting or rejecting hillier and mccolgan s   conclusion  more insight on this re  lationship in family firms may also  distantly and indirectly help inform relationships in monarchies in political succession  since it is almost impossible to conduct similar studies on monarchies  given that by definition when a successor is not from the ruling family the rule of the monarchy has ended   second  our review also identified some recent impactful articles studying the important effect of family versus non family ceo succes  sion on family firm performance  for example  pÃ©rez gonzÃ¡lez    bennedsen et al     and cucculelli and micucci   found that family ceo successions  as compared to non family professional ceo successions  had a negative impact on family firm performance  how  ever  it is obvious from the literature and from real life experience that  despite these findings  families tend to prefer intra family successions over extra family successions  nonetheless  only very recently  pan et al    examined a factor   corporate philanthropy   that could help mitigate the negative impact of family ceo succession on family firm performance  we believe more studies are needed to investigate additional factors  moderators  and mediators that may mitigate this important family ceo succession performance relationship  this re  lationship also suggests that when families pass the baton to family members  they have in mind considerations other than just short term financial performance    future research needs to uncover what these considerations are that may be as important  if not more important  to family firm ceo incumbents  than their firm s short term performance  this may also indirectly inform political leadership succession in monarchies and dictatorships  in which the survival  continuity  and longevity of these monarchies and dictatorships may become more important to incum  bents than how well they are serving their people   leadership succession and gender primogeniture  our review of the recent impactful literature on leadership succes  sion and gender primogeniture in pofos identified only two articles   despite the importance of implicit and or explicit gender primogeniture considerations in the successor selection process in family firms  these considerations are not only important in leadership succession in family firms but may be even more important in leadership successions in pos such as monarchies  b  farah  et al  the leadership quarterly             and dictatorships  the two articles we identified generally discuss the challenges daughters face in family business succession and find that male first child firms are more likely to pass on control to a family ceo than are female first child firms  for instance  in the middle east  when it comes to inheritance and tax law  many countries  inheritance and tax laws follow religious sectarian laws that are very different from wes  tern civil law and  in certain cases  may prohibit transferring wealth   or power   to daughters   that said  we are in an era in which gender equity in general and in leadership succession in particular is increasing around the world  however  this progress is still generally fairly slow  but faster in some parts of the world than others  this suggests several timely research questions need to be addressed in the near future  research questions such as  how do culture   country   and or region specific gender re  lated beliefs  norms  practices  etc  differentially influence succession processes and outcomes in family firms    do egali  tarian families   distribute ownership and leadership of their family firms   among their male and female children  and if so how  how are the media in general and the social media in parti  cular influencing perceptions on gender and how is this influencing leadership succession processes and decisions in privately owned fa  mily firms     moreover  in the leadership succession in pos literature  there is a clear need for more sustained and comprehensive research on the feminization of political elites and their role in succession processes  we argue the same for the other two literatures  we need to know more about what sorts of women are populating business and political elites  how they negotiate among and between groups  and how they approach power  in the conclusion of her study of gender  political performance  and party leadership  o brien   points out that  parties are themselves fundamentally gendered institutions   and so  in  corporating gender will thus shed new light on the  black box  of in  traparty politics   jalalzai and krook   survey the global feminization trend in legislatures across the globe  noting that while there are record numbers of women in cabinet positions  politics is still largely viewed as  a man s world   in light of our search revealing only    of the pos  articles   substantively focused on the role of gender  we conclude there is much necessity to understand how gender affects  and is affected by  change in political executives   leader tenure  ceo tenure is used to predict many dependent variables in the ceo succession literature including organizational performance  while the ceo position is known to be demanding  we see many ceos reluctant to let go of their organizations especially if the organization is successful  leaders in family businesses enjoy longer tenures and are more en  trenched than in ptos    dangerously though  ceo reluctance to leave may lead to the exit of very capable successors   who lose hope of reaching the ceo position  lehmberg et al    studied the impact on firm performance when firms hired executives who had left general electric during the twenty year tenure of jack welch   in addition  henderson  miller  and hambrick   found that firm performance has an inverted u shaped relation with ceo tenure  hence the relation between ceo tenure and firm performance is first positive then becomes negative beyond a certain point in time and it turns negative earlier in more dynamic  than in less dynamic  in  dustries  while this is one of the very few academic studies discussing ceos  tenure  albeit indirectly  practitioners and consultants are still expressing concerns about  open  terms for ceos  mader   and whitehead   have supported term limits  they state that ceos should have an optimum time to serve irrespective of their age  for example  the governor of central bank of kenya  patrick njorge  is in favor of setting a limited term for ceos after some of the veteran ceos failed to pay their loans    others disagree  myatt    and abou el fotouh   argue that good leadership is hard to find and they support the retention of good ceos irrespective of their tenure length  sonnenfeld   argues that it depends on the ceo whether he or she is a monarch who would like to stay at the helm indefinitely  or a general who returns to the company to save it  or an ambassador who trains an heir apparent to succeed him her and then leaves  or a governor with a short but effective term at the office   yet if we look at the sibling field of political succession  especially in democratic systems with explicit term limit laws  no matter how suc  cessful or popular are the leaders  they have to cede their position upon completion of their term  although defined leadership terms may apply in some ptos and pofos  such as deloitte  which imposes a tenure limited to two consecutive four year terms    and many universities which impose similar kinds of defined terms on their presidents  it may be advantageous for firms to experiment with such defined leadership terms and may be interesting for business re  searchers to investigate whether defined or undefined terms result in better succession and performance  pto scholars may extend henderson et al  s   study and compare the effect of ceos  tenure on firm performance in limited term firms with unlimited term firms and across industries  optimization models can be used to identify the optimal tenures of ceos in different industries   leader removal dismissal  ceo dismissal in ptos research has been directly linked to firm fi  nancial performance  researchers found that poor financial perfor  mance is the major cause for ceo dismissal  however  more recently researchers found mitigating factors  such as structural power   and political connectedness    that might affect this relationship  keeping a poor performer in the ceo position  this research has been conducted in the chinese context mainly and given that china has a unique political system in which political con  nectedness may have more influence than in other contexts  it might be interesting to validate this research in different cultures  there is less research done on leader dismissal in pos and pofos and probably for valid reasons  however  it might be interesting to study the mitigating factors that might influence the removal of poor performers in these two fields  understanding the mitigating factors might enrich these two fields both theoretically and empirically and might improve practice  understanding what prevents dismissal of poor performers may moti  vate the custodians of the succession process to seek removal of these leaders through the appropriate channels when necessary   the  participatory revolution  and succession  our review of leadership succession in pos showed that along with the entry of larger numbers of women into modern political executives  another group of newcomers merits much more analytical attention in future research  our analysis suggests several leading scholars  in  cluding kenig    kenig    cross and blais    and barnea and rahat    are concentrating attention on the  participatory revolution  that is underway within the selectorates of many democ  racies  this is meritorious as efforts to expand the group controlling party leader selection in democratic systems carries with it a host of consequences that are only now beginning to be articulated  indeed  several of the analyses in our collection of political democratic studies are not designed to consider a changing selectorate  for example  in the conclusion of his study of how change in the party leader reduces voter disagreement about party positions  somer topcu underscores that his analysis is limited in this regard  he writes   we do not know whether the process of leadership selection influences voter perceptions  do voters learn more about party positions when the party members elect the party leader in a one member  one vote system as compared to selection by the party executive committee      we need to know more about what the democratization of the selectorate implies  b  farah  et al  the leadership quarterly             for the process and result of executive succession   leadership succession and institutions  our review of leadership succession in pos also demonstrated there is ample focus on the role of institutions across democratic and non  democratic systems with respect to understanding succession  there is much attention because institutions matter significantly in how suc  cessions unfold and in their consequences  moreover  institutional ef  fects often are subtle and counter intuitive  revealed only through careful analysis  going forward  several analysts recommend devoting more attention to key institutional factors  particularly in how they interact with other elements and factors  kenig    wauters    horiuchi et al     konrad and mui    and frantz and stein    among others  emphasize the need to pursue additional re  search focused on institutional factors  along with situational and per  haps psychological factors  to fully explore the role of institutions in leadership succession  as ennser jedenastik and mÃ¼ller   con  clude  research on party leader survival is very much in its infancy  and so a better understanding of the institutional determinants of leader selection and deselection is crucial for students of democratic politics   leadership succession around the world  this section discusses future directions related to factors affecting succession in different cultures  countries  and regions  our review of leadership succession in pofos identified several articles that studied leadership succession in pofos in distinct single countries  such as in italy  lebanon  china  turkey  etc     except for yan and sorenson    these and the other articles on leadership succession in pofos have rarely  if at all  investigated in any depth the impact of the culture  country  or region in which these studies were conducted on the succession process  in contrast  a good number of the political leadership succession articles included com  parative studies among countries  however  among the pofo succes  sion articles  only carney et al    comparatively studied the di  vergent impact of inheritance law in four different countries   on succession and continuity in family firms   thus  more comparative cultural  national  and regional studies on leadership succession in pofos and ptos are needed to help better understand the impact of various external factors   on leadership succession in these organizations  for instance  certain cultures  such as those with strong traditions of long term orientation and social obligations  may facilitate specific types of succession over others  moreover  in certain national or regional cultures intra family successions may be more or less common and or legitimate than others  the same way in certain national or re  gional cultures democratic or non democratic political leadership suc  cessions may be more or less common and or legitimate than others  studying the impact of various external factors related to cultural  na  tional  and regional differences on leadership succession in all three organizational types would significantly advance our understanding of leadership succession in different international contexts   what business and political successions may learn    in this paper we reviewed the literatures on leadership succession in ptos  pofos  and pos  we also proposed future directions that we believe are critical to move forward the leadership succession field in the three areas in the near future  in this concluding section  based on fig     tables          and      and our literature review and future directions sections  we further integrate the three literatures on leadership succession by discussing their similarities and  differences  what all three literatures may learn from this review  what each literature may learn from the other literatures  and what addi  tional important research questions should be studied in the near fu  ture   similarities among the three literatures    among other things  our literature review and future directions sections revealed the following similarities  all three literatures have limitedly studied the relationship between gender   and succession  given the timeliness of this topic  we think all three literatures can benefit from a deeper understanding of this relationship and its implications   reviewing fig     tables          and     and our literature review and future directions sections revealed the following additional similarities that were not discussed in the three previous future directions sections  first  characteristics of leadership successions  namely  planned versus unplanned business successions and regular versus irregular political successions  have been fairly well studied in all three literatures  yet  given the benefits of planned busi  ness successions and regular political successions and the detriments of unplanned business successions and irregular political successions we think more research examining leadership succession characteristics in general and what factors increase the likelihood of planned and regular successions and decrease the likelihood of unplanned and irregular successions in particular would significantly advance leadership suc  cession research and practice   second  the impact of succession on leaders  attributes has been limitedly studied in all three literatures  particularly in pos  given john acton s famous quote  power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely   conducting research examining whether how becoming a leader changes a person s behavior in general and ex  amining how valid such quotes are would be interesting and useful to succession researchers and practitioners   third  the effect of succession on environmental attributes   has been barely studied in all three literatures  although one would expect environ  mental attributes to impact leaders  succession more than one would expect leaders  succession to impact environmental attributes  many new leaders significantly impact their environments  such as the in  dustries  institutions  political landscapes  or the other environments they operate in  investigating what incoming leaders  attributes may lead to such environmental changes can advance succession research and practice   differences among the three literatures    among other things  our literature review and future directions sections revealed the following differences  leader attributes and suc  cession has been well studied in ptos and pofos but limitedly studied in pos  understanding how  when  and what leader characteristics im  pact succession and performance in all three organizations  but parti  cularly in pos  will enrich the understanding of leadership succession researchers and practitioners in all three literatures   moreover  organizational performance before and after succession has been studied in ptos and pofos but barely in pos  given the im  portance of these relationships we think that all three literatures  but particularly the pos literature  can benefit from further examining these relationships in new ways and using additional organization relevant measures of performance   furthermore  leader term limits have been studied in pos   but rarely in ptos and pofos  given the significant implications of term limits in politics  one may wonder whether term limits would have similar implications in business  investigating whether  why  how   b  farah  et al  the leadership quarterly             and when leader term limits would benefit or hurt business organiza  tions may be a fruitful avenue for future research on leadership suc  cession in business organizations   reviewing fig     tables          and     and our literature review and future directions sections revealed the following additional differences that were not discussed in the three previous future directions sections   first  the impact of environmental attributes   on succession has been studied in ptos and pos but barely in pofos  studying the impact of en  vironmental attributes on succession in pofos   would advance leadership succession research and practice in pofos in par  ticular and succession research and practice in the field in general   second  characteristics of leadership successions  namely  internal versus external successions and intra family versus extra family suc  cessions  have been well studied in ptos and pofos but limitedly studied in pos  studying presidential  prime ministerial  etc  intra party   versus extra party   successions and their effects on countries  policies  economies  security situations  etc  may advance leadership succession research and prac  tice in pos   third  our review located some theory papers attempting to broadly  explain the leadership succession phenomenon in pofos but barely any theory papers attempting to broadly explain this phenomenon in ptos or pos  we hope this observation encourages researchers and practi  tioners from the three leadership succession areas to collaborate more and learn from one another in both research and practice to ideally develop a general normative theory of leadership succession  since such a scholarly theory does not exist yet and its existence would certainly help move the scholarly leadership succession field forward and better guide practitioners in their succession decisions   acknowledgements  the first author acknowledges the support provided by the

trend in leadership research is to explore the daily causes and consequences of leadership behaviors  as this type of research has grown dramatically in the past several years  we seek to provide a systematic review of existing empirical research that has used a daily esm study design to examine the leadership process  in this review  we reflect on the unique and important benefits a daily perspective on leadership provides for leadership research  we also provide a systematic review of the existing research on daily leadership  discuss the metho  dological and theoretical aspects of the studies identified in the review  and highlight the important findings of this research  finally  we conclude by drawing upon the reviewed articles to provide recommendations for future scholarly work  specifically  we give recommendations that will both broaden scholars  understanding of the daily leadership process as well as deepen understanding   every workday  leaders are responsible for the performance and well being of their followers  and the ways in which leaders interact with their followers may differ from day to day or even within the day  for example  research shows that ethical behavior   such as role  modeling ethical behaviors to followers   drains leaders  ego resources  which increases the likelihood that they will behave more abusively towards their followers the next day    this and other studies show that leadership is a daily and fluctuating phe  nomenon  prior scholarly work in the leadership field has primarily explored the consequences of leaders  general behavioral patterns on follower outcomes    recently  however  leadership researchers have begun to ex  plore the dynamics of daily leadership behaviors    this daily perspective to understand leader  ship has grown rapidly in the past few years  refining our understanding of leadership  expanding our understanding of the daily consequences of leadership behaviors  and extending our understanding of the im  mediate origins of leadership behaviors   the behaviors of all individuals can be explored as general patterns of consistent actions in a trait like fashion    but can also be examined at specific moments in time in a state like fashion    likewise  leader  ship behaviors  such as transformational or abusive leader behaviors  can be examined as a general pattern of behavior   or as a behavior that fluctuates within short time periods    previous research supports this idea  showing that some leaders are more transformational than others   and that the use of transfor  mational leadership often fluctuates within the same leader on a daily basis    prior research has also highlighted how followers  daily reports of a leader s behavior are significantly different from their reports of the same leader s general leadership behavior     in this paper  we look to review existing research that examines the daily causes and consequences of leadership  in doing so  we build on prior reviews that have discussed daily leadership       received   november    received in revised form   october    accepted   november    â the authors would like to thank david day and

leadership  while mcclean et al    included a wider range of changing leadership behaviors such as longer term leader behavioral shifts and leader behavioral growth and decay  we solely focus on daily behaviors  as a con  sequence  our review is more comprehensive of the daily leadership literature and highlights unique elements and patterns    this allows us to more precisely assess both the strengths and weaknesses in current research  it also allows us to provide more de  tailed suggestions for future research  second  our review builds on ohly and gochmann s   review of daily leadership  which pri  marily focused on specifying methodological best practices for daily leadership research  our review does not provide specific methodolo  gical best practices per se  but rather assesses the state of the science in daily leadership to see how it meets current best practices already provided   thus  the aim of this manuscript is to review and evaluate previous research examining the daily causes and consequences of leadership behaviors  in doing this  we hope to inform scholars on how previous daily studies of leadership have   utilized their study designs to theoretically advance leadership knowledge  we believe that by highlighting what has been done in daily leadership studies  we can spark future leadership inquiry by helping scholars look at leadership research through a slightly different lens  in what follows  we first re  flect on the value added by studying leadership in a daily fashion  then  based on our systematic review of the literature  we review the existing empirical research conducted by scholars that has explored leadership on a daily basis  we do this by first summarizing the theories used by articles in our review  second  analyzing the methods used in the arti  cles in our review  and  third reviewing the articles based on the be  haviors studied  finally  in our conclusion  we discuss areas for future research based on our review  we provide suggestions that will push the field forward and establish a road map for further inquiry in daily leadership research   importance of examining daily leadership  there are at least three important theoretical and methodological advantages to study daily leadership relations  the first is that scholars are able to examine phenomena and test leadership theories at a within  person level    the within person approach to leadership allows researchers to answer unique research questions that complement the existing nomological network surrounding leadership with novel information on the work  ings of leadership  second  understanding daily leadership allows re  searchers to get an in depth look at the short term processes of lea  dership    it also provides insight into how leadership behaviors unfold over short spans of time    third  it allows researchers to analyze leadership behaviors in their natural context  studying daily life of any sort  be it leadership  student life  or parenting  allows researchers to  capture life as it is lived     leadership is a complex process  and thus  studying leadership in a daily fashion is critical to fully understand it as it gives unique insight that cannot be easily captured in other ways  below  we describe each of these three benefits in more detail   within person approach to leadership  existing leadership research primarily focuses on leadership at a between person level  studying differences in general patterns of  behaviors between different leaders  these studies provide valuable insights to select individuals for a leadership position  for example  previous research has shown that individuals who score highly on agreeableness and honesty humility scales are less likely to behave abusively towards their followers    but daily studies on leadership provide unique information to scholars by allowing researchers to explore leadership at another level of analysis   the within person level   on a daily basis  even personality  a mean  ingful way to explain differences between individuals  has been shown to be worth studying on a daily basis to understand within person re  lationships    and although there are other notable types of within person studies focusing on leader development over time   or following interventions or changes    daily studies are different with their focus on short term   within person re  lationships in leadership   daily within person leadership studies both challenge the way we view leadership   and show how leadership relations exist at multiple levels of analysis  daily within persons stu  dies of leadership can show how leader relations that are non existent at the between person level exist at a within person level  for example  at the between person level  leader abusive behaviors and leader be  haviors of consideration and structure initiation are likely to be nega  tively correlated  however  on a within person  daily level they have been found to positively relate to each other    in a related example  breevaart et al    showed that leaders can be transformational  rewarding  and controlling all on the same day  thus  daily within person leadership research can change and challenge preconceived relations in leadership   daily studies also extend leadership research by showing that re  lations exist at multiple levels of analysis  this extends theories of leadership by showing that both general leadership behaviors and daily leadership behaviors have implications for leader and follower ante  cedents and outcomes  within person studies demonstrate the need for leaders to behave constructively not only in general but also on a daily basis  for example  transformational leadership at the between person level of analysis has been found to increase employee job engagement    daily studies have shown that this relationship also exists at a within person level of analysis     short term processes of leadership  another theoretical and methodological advantage of daily studies of leadership is that they allow researchers to study the complexity of leadership processes as they unfold from one day or situation to the next  scholars can examine what daily situations trigger different types of constructive   and destructive   leadership behaviors and better explore the proximal consequences of these leader behaviors  this helps give scholars a deeper and more nuanced view of short term relationships in leadership  knowledge of these proximal situational triggers of lea  dership behaviors have theoretical implications and provide important information to optimize the practice of leadership  for example  barnes  lucianetti  bhave  and christian   asked leaders when they woke up to indicate how many hours they slept and how well they slept  they found that regardless of the hours of sleep  leaders who reported lower sleep quality in the morning   also reported having depleted egos  which caused their followers to report they were more abusive that day  thus  if sleep affects the use of abusive leadership behaviors  organizations could decide to grant their leaders a day off after a night of working overtime  or leaders them  selves may decide to work from home the next day   daily studies also allow scholars to use more specific variables to test theories and thus uniquely explore the leadership process  studies    of the   articles in our review  only   were reviewed in the mcclean et al    article   t k  kelemen  et al  the leadership quarterly             that use precise  specific variables complement more traditional studies of leadership by allowing scholars to measure and examine leadership processes in different ways  for example  rosen et al    explored how daily email demands  instead of just general work demands  in the morning influenced leader behaviors during the day  similarly  stocker  jacobshagen  krings  pfister  and semmer   examined how daily leader appreciation  instead of just general leader support  leads to enhanced follower outcomes for the day  finally  ford  wang  jin  and eisenberger   explored how daily leader support increased fol  lower daily gratitude   rather than just positive affect   which increased follower daily organizational citizenship behavior   and decreased follower counterproductive work behaviors    thus  daily studies allow researchers to get deeper insights into specific aspects of daily life and how they relate to the process of leadership   daily studies also provide important information on how time af  fects short term leadership processes  daily studies can examine how long the effects of leadership behaviors last for followers and leaders  they can also show how the timing of leadership behaviors is im  portant  for example  qin  huang  johnson  hu  and ju   found that leader daily abusive behaviors increased leader work engagement the next day but that it had a negative effect on leader work engage  ment after several days  in general  daily studies can incorporate time into leadership research to provide further information into the short  term process of leadership   leadership in its natural context  finally  daily studies of leadership often examine leadership in its natural context rather than in a special environment such as a labora  tory setting  measuring behaviors as they naturally and spontaneously occur is what makes the study of daily behaviors fundamentally dif  ferent from both laboratory and field studies that use global self reports    gathering contextualized information is one of the major ad  vantages of daily studies    for example  employees are often asked to rate their leader s behavior when they are at work  rather than in a lab or at home  studying behaviors and feelings in their natural context is important because the context plays an important role in eliciting these behaviors and feelings  additionally  feelings and emotions are transient in nature    when your leader s behavior elicits certain feelings  these feelings may have dis  appeared by the time you got home  or they may have been affected by other experiences  so  the closer the measure is to the actual experience  the better   in addition  the embeddedness of daily studies in the natural context is also relevant when studying leadership behaviors that cannot be studied in the lab for ethical or practical reasons  due to ethical con  cerns  daily studies become of paramount importance for abusive leader behaviors or other types of destructive leadership behaviors  because it would be unethical to experimentally manipulate destructive leader  ship behaviors such as publicly ridiculing someone or blaming someone for something  he did not do  these behaviors can be studied as they naturally occur during the day  in addition  from an external validity standpoint  leadership can be difficult to authentically create in a la  boratory setting  which makes it uniquely important to study leadership in the field  while laboratory studies of leader behaviors can provide important insight into leadership    an encounter with an actor  a pre recorded video  or written description of a leader carries ecological validity limitations  for these reasons  leadership derives distinct advantages from being studied in a daily fashion   review process  experience sampling methodology  our review focuses on leadership studies that utilized experience sampling methodology   to measure daily leadership behaviors  which we refer to as  daily leadership studies   esm is a methodological approach that allows researchers to better capture real time experi  ences    that is  rather than having partici  pants reflect back on experiences and feelings that happened in the past  esm allows scholars to measure experiences and feelings as they occur    there are three types of esm methods    the first is collecting data at a specified interval   is called interval contingent sampling  this method is one of the most common ways of employing esm in leadership studies    it is used to study phe  nomena at fixed times  for example at     am to report about one s sleep that night and at     pm to report about one s workday  because this type of sampling introduces some type of memory bias    it is best used to measure experiences and behaviors that are somewhat resistant to memory bias   the second type of esm invites participants to input data every time they are notified by the researchers  usually by email or through an electronic notification device    this type of sampling is called signal contingent sampling and can be used to measure ongoing experiences that are likely affected by the predictability of measurement and memory bias  participants are asked to report their current experiences when they receive a signal  this type of sampling is also referred to as experience sampling  the third type of esm collects data at an event level    and is called event based sampling  in this type of design  participants are asked to respond to a survey every time a particular event or interaction occurs  by having partici  pants respond immediately following the event in question  researchers can minimize recall bias  event based sampling is especially useful to capture rare phenomena because participants only report on their ex  periences when a specified event happens    collec  tively  these three ways of conducting esm studies give scholars a variety of ways to design their studies depending on their research questions   systematic review  we conducted our search for empirical leadership studies by searching in ebsco and web of science  we focused our search on studies that examined leadership behaviors     either measured by the leader or follower  to identify articles relevant to our review we searched for leader   manager   or supervis  as well as one of the following keywords  daily report  experience sampling  event sampling  diary stud   or daily diary  in our search process  we confirmed that the articles aligned with the aim of the review by    including leadership behaviors     measuring variables at the daily level  and    including a dependent variable    through this search process  we found   articles  we then added two articles   of which we were aware  bringing our total to   articles  below  in table    we provide a summary of each article included in our review  we first summarize the theories and models used in the articles  then provide a synthesis of the methodological approaches used  and finally review the articles based on leadership behavior studied   t k  kelemen  et al  the leadership quarterly             table

using theory to develop ar  guments  whereas the leadership field has been criticized for its lack of solid leadership theories    several different theoretical perspectives have been adopted to understand the causes and consequences of daily leadership  most studies identified in our review utilized an overall model or theoretical framework to build their arguments    but there was a portion of ar  ticles that failed to use an overarching theoretical framework to guide their arguments    we identified three dominant types of theoretical perspectives to explain the daily causes and con  sequences of leadership  namely stressor strain theories    affect emotion theories    and motivation theories    in total  these three types of theoretical perspectives made up    all the studies in our review that relied upon theory and    of all the articles in our review  in addition to these three types of theoretical perspectives  seven articles used social theories    six articles used cognitive theories    and three used leadership theories    the other articles used a variety of other theoretical perspec  tives such as justice theory  psychological contracts theory  etc  table   reports the theory or model used by each study  and table   sum  marizes the theoretical perspectives used in daily leadership research   importantly  not all leadership research is appropriate for daily study  studies that look at long term changes in leadership or stable relations are not well suited for daily studies  however  during our review process  we were pleased to observe that the majority of articles did use daily leadership studies to answer questions that could not have been answered as effectively using other methods  many studies looked at the antecedents or outcomes of short term factors  which are the types of things best studied for daily esm studies  also  many studies used stressor strain theories or affect emotion theories as their overall theoretical perspective  the studies of specific stressors  affect  and emotions related to leadership are the types of theoretical questions that are well suited to be examined in a daily fashion because they can be short lived   review of methodological approaches  while prior research has already provided advice on how to conduct general   and leadership specific   esm studies  we highlight the methodological prac  tices currently employed by researchers who study the daily leadership practice  by summarizing common methodological practices  we hope to show patterns  strengths  and weaknesses in current methodological designs  because there is diversity in the methodological practices used in existing research  we discuss the articles by data sources  response rates  and study designs  table   gives a summary of the study methods and study designs used by the articles in our review   data source  of the samples included in our review  a majority of them used data only from followers    some used only leader report data    and a small number of samples used data from both leaders and followers    one study used both follower and customer data    both follower and leader reports used to explore the daily re  lations of leadership are valid and useful  yet  it is important to note that a majority of our information about the daily aspects of leadership are from follower perceptions  the studies that did include leaders in their samples typically did not specify the type or level of leader measured  this is unfortunate because a leader s level within the or  ganization has important implications for understanding leadership and  table   theoretical perspectives   theory number of studies  affective events theory   job demands resource theory

articles had more than one sample   t k  kelemen  et al  the leadership quarterly             should be included in future research  finally  most studies relied upon a single source for their data collection    of course  collecting multiple measures from multiple par  ticipants at multiple points in time can be challenging  but study de  signs that do collect data from multiple sources overcome issues of common method bias    this is important because esm study designs do not overcome the weaknesses of common method bias in and of themselves     response rates and inclusion criteria  while response rates varied across studies  most studies got response rates between   and     before analyzing the data  some studies excluded data from participants who completed less than             or      of the surveys  also  re  sponses were excluded for participants who responded when not at work    responded outside of the specified time frame   or when data was not available for both the leader and follower  finally  some studies had missing data because participants were instructed to report the number of interac  tions they had with their leader on a day and responses were excluded when participants did not interact with their leader during the day    however  even though most articles had to deal with a substantial amount of missing data due to the nature of esm studies  almost no articles mentioned the use of modern missing data techniques    we hope future daily leadership studies will better utilize these missing data techniques   type of daily esm study  interval contingent most samples in our review used interval contingent sampling  with    of     using this sampling method  of these samples    of   collected measures once a day    of   collected measures twice a day    of   collected measures thrice a day  and   collected measures four or more times a day  collecting data once a day for a day to day study design  such as exploring how previous day factors affects next day leader behavior    temporally separates independent from dependent variables and reduces common method bias  yet  several studies in our review not only used single source data  but also collected their independent and dependent variables at the same time  scholars that explore the daily aspects of leadership using an interval contingent sampling design benefit by having temporal se  paration between their independent and dependent variables  particu  larly when they are collecting all their data from a single source  future research should temporally separate independent and dependent vari  ables where possible  many interval contingent samples also fail to capitalize on measuring leadership relationship in their natural context by having participant s complete measure at home  or after work   the number of days included in interval contingent samples ranged from three days to over a month  of the samples in our review    of     measured responses for     days    of     measured re  sponses for     days  and   of     measured responses for   or more days  prior research on esm study designs has recommended measuring participants for at least   days    therefore  future leadership researchers should do better at following this best practice or explain why they deviate from this recommendation   signal contingent only six samples used a signal contingent study design  two studies  relied upon leader reports  and three relied upon follower reports  three studies collected measures once per day  and two studies  collected measures four or more times a day  one study collected data for     days  and the other four studies collected data for     days  these studies followed best practice   event based six samples used event based sampling  five of the samples used  follower reported data and one sample used both leader  and follower  reported data  two samples lasted     days  three lasted     days  and one lasted   or more days  the number of times participants re  sponded per day depended upon the number of times the event being measured occurred each day  this study design allows researchers to get as proximal to leader behaviors or follower outcomes as possible because participants respond right after the event being studied occurs  based on the current state of the science  these relations are less stu  died  in addition  this type of study design fully captures the benefit of daily studies of capturing  life as it is lived    by measuring leadership relations in their natural context and as close to their occurrence as possible  we hope future research will utilize this study design more often   review of leader behaviors  we review the literature on daily leadership research by discussing the findings organized by leadership behavior    the sections on each behavior are organized by    a summary of methods and theories used for the leader behavior     a summary of the direct and indirect consequences of the daily leader behavior     a summary of the causes   of the daily leadership be  havior  and    a summary of the leader behavior as a moderator be  tween daily relations   daily transformational leadership behaviors  methods and theory we found   articles that explored the daily aspects of transfor   mational leader behaviors and the sub facets of transformational lea  dership    out of the   articles that we found    used interval contingent sampling and   used signal con  tingent sampling    in addition  the samples of ten studies consisted of only followers  the samples of three studies only included leaders  two studies included both leaders and followers  and one study included both followers and their customers    finally  a range of different theories were used to study daily transformational leadership  the most frequently used being job demands resources theory  transformational leadership theory  and self determination theory   consequences eleven out of sixteen articles in our review explored the daily  consequences of leader transformational behaviors for followers and the leaders themselves  showing that daily transformational leadership behaviors have positive  proximal consequences for both  first  daily transformational leadership behaviors have been found to increase followers  state job engagement on a daily basis via an increase in fol  lowers  optimism    autonomy  or social support    in addition to job engagement  on days that leaders show more transformational leadership  followers engage in more job crafting behaviors    experience more positive affect    have an increase in positive job attitudes    display more personal initiative    and are more likely to cooperate with their team members    followers also report more daily positive emotions when they rate their leader as transformational    work by tepper et al    found that daily transformational leader behaviors increase follower state positive affect and job satisfaction  but only when followers feel a  t k  kelemen  et al  the leadership quarterly             need for transformational leadership  in addition to the daily con  sequences of transformational leadership for followers  lanaj et al    found that daily transformational leader behaviors increased the leaders  own state positive affect and decreased their state negative affect   causes our review identified four daily studies that highlighted the prox   imal antecedents of daily transformational leadership behavior  two of these studies show that daily job demands and characteristics affect leaders  daily use of transformational behavior  daily email demands were found to reduce leaders  daily transformational behaviors via goal progress    while situational factors like planning  problem solving  and brainstorming were found to lead to increases in day to day use of transformational leader behaviors    both of these articles are great examples of articles measuring specific variables that would be difficult to capture without using esm   from a frequency perspective  johnson et al    found that individuals with a high collective   identity displayed higher mean levels of transformational leadership behaviors and less daily variation in their transformational leadership behaviors  finally  venus  johnson  zhang  wang  and lanaj   explored proximal antecedents to a specific component of transformational leader behavior   vision communication  they found that when a lea  der s construal level   is high in the morning  leaders engage in more vision communication behaviors later in the day  taken together  the daily demands  tasks  and perspectives of a leader affect when a leader engages in daily transformational leadership behaviors   moderators breevaart and bakker   found that daily transformational  leadership enhances the positive effects of daily cognitive and workload demands onto followers  daily work engagement and reduces the ne  gative effect between daily role conflict and followers  work engage  ment  thus  daily transformational leader behaviors can enhance the positive effects of followers  daily challenge demands and reduce the negative effects of daily hindrances  relatedly  bono et al    found that the negative daily relation between follower emotion regulation and daily job satisfaction was buffered by transformational leadership   daily transactional leadership behaviors and initiating structure  methods and theory we found six studies on daily transactional leadership  almost all of  which   used interval contingent sampling  half of the studies   included only followers  whereas the other half   gath  ered data just from the leaders  in the studies  different theories were used  ranging from boundary theory   to affective events theory   to psychological contract theory     consequences two out of six articles explored the proximal consequences of leader  transactional and initiating structure behaviors  like transformational leader behaviors  the daily use of contingent reward behavior was found to be indirectly and positively related to followers  daily work engagement via both autonomy and social support    however  daily active management by exception was found to be negatively related to follower engagement via decreases in daily autonomy    furthermore  tomprou and nikolaou   showed that daily newcomer beliefs in promises made by people within their organization were higher when these promises were made by their line managers compared to hr managers and top management   causes three studies looked at proximal antecedents to daily transactional  and initiating structure behaviors  yeung and shen   found leader authentic pride to be associated with more structure initiating and consideration behaviors  rosen et al    found that for leaders low in self control  daily email demands led to decreases in leader structure initiating behaviors through a decrease in goal progress  finally  nielsen and cleal   showed that the more leaders engaged in daily planning  problem solving  and evaluation of tasks  the more flow they experienced at work   moderators finally  one study examined a transactional leader behavior as a  moderator between follower daily behaviors  derks et al    found that when leaders expect followers to be online after work hours  the positive relation between followers  daily smartphone use and daily work home interference is strengthened   daily abusive leadership behaviors  methods and theory overall  we found twelve studies on daily abusive behaviors  in   cluding leader incivility  most used interval contingent sampling    and one study   used event contingent sampling  five studies focused solely on followers  whereas three stu  dies focused on the leaders and three studies focused on both leaders and followers  most studies built on affect or emotion theories  such as affective events theory    or stressor strain the  ories  such as ego depletion   and conservations of resources theory    compared to other leader behaviors  daily studies on abusive leader behaviors have tended to draw from similar types of theoretical perspectives   consequences seven studies looked at the daily consequences of leader abusive  behaviors  first  vogel and mitchell   showed that daily abusive leadership behaviors lead to an increase in followers  daily workplace deviance due to a daily loss of self esteem  daily abusive leader beha  vior has also been found to decrease followers  daily intrinsic motiva  tion   and daily work engagement   and increase followers  turnover intentions    in addition  followers often exhibit incivility towards their leaders in response to incivility they experienced that day     the daily use of abusive leader behaviors also has consequences for the leaders themselves  interestingly  engaging in abusive leader be  haviors in the morning causes leaders to experience guilt and a sense of lost moral credits  and as a result  leaders are more likely to engage in constructive leader behaviors in the afternoon    abusive leader behaviors during the day have also been found to result in decreased need fulfillment and relaxation at the end of the day    in contrast  research has found that abusive leader behaviors during the day can lead to enhanced recovery at the end of the day due to leader resource conservation and leads to next day leader work engagement    however  the recovery effects due to abusive leader behaviors seem to be short lived  and engaging in these abusive behaviors has a negative effect on leaders  work en  gagement after several days  taken together  these findings suggest that additional future work is needed to synthesize the conflicting personal consequences of leader abusive behaviors on the leaders themselves   causes five studies explored the short term daily antecedents to abusive  leader behaviors  specifically  it has been found that a leader s previous night s sleep quality   and previous day s level of family to work conflict   increase the leader s depletion of ego resources  which leads to more abusive leader  t k  kelemen  et al  the leadership quarterly             behaviors the next day  also  johnson et al    found that leaders with an individual   identity showed higher daily mean levels of abusive supervision and less variation in their abusive super  vision behaviors  other studies highlight how daily feelings of psy  chological power can increase daily abusive behaviors    and how leader pride can also be a source of daily abusive leader behaviors    thus  both pre work factors  such as sleep quality and family interaction  and a leader s psychological and emotional state are important antecedents of daily abusive behaviors   moderators finally  two studies explored abusive leader behaviors as a mod   erator  one study found that followers were more likely to experience daily anger after receiving a negatively toned message when it came from a leader   who was high in abusive behaviors    bormann   found that previous day abusive supervision moderates the relation between ethical leadership and follower engagement  the work by bormann   is an excellent example of a within person study that challenges how we view lea  dership by showing that leaders may be abusive one day but ethical another  it is also a good example of showing how two types of leader behaviors interact with each other on a day to day basis   daily leader justice behaviors  methods and theory eight studies focused on daily justice behaviors of leaders  exploring  both the causes and the consequences of daily justice behaviors  leader justice behaviors include behaving equitably  fairly  and without bias  all of these articles used interval contingent sampling  affective events theory was used most often    justice   and motivation theories   were used as well   consequences five studies explored the daily consequences of leader justice be   haviors  when followers perceive that their leaders exhibit low levels of justice on a given day  this leads to increases in follower daily negative emotions  which then increases followers  likelihood to engage in cwbs    also  followers feel more job satisfaction and less hostility on days that their leader displays more interpersonal justice    similarly  followers experience less anger when their leader behaves with interactional justice  which then in  directly reduces follower daily cwb    and leaders that vary in their justice behaviors from day to day increase followers  daily stress which increases followers  daily job dissatisfaction and daily emotional exhaustion    with regard to the con  sequences for leaders themselves  research has found that daily proce  dural justice behaviors are draining for leaders but that daily interac  tional justice behaviors are replenishing for leaders  both indirectly affect leader ocb     causes two studies have looked at the causes of daily leader justice beha   viors  leaders  daily cognitive motives of compliance  identity main  tenance  and fairness  and their affective motives of positive and ne  gative affect all were found to influence their daily practice of justice behaviors    sherf et al    showed that leaders  daily workload induces leaders to prioritize technical tasks over justice behaviors  which decreases their daily behaviors of justice rule ad  herence    the study by sherf et al    is an excellent example of a daily leadership study exploring the short term process of leadership using specific variables that would have been difficult to study in an  other way   moderators finally  one study explored leader justice behaviors as a moderator   high levels of daily leader displays of interactional justice were found to minimize the positive effects between nostalgia and both daily in  trinsic motivation and daily work effort    thus  interactional justice can act as a compensatory mechanism for em  ployees that feel low levels of nostalgia  the research on leader daily justice behaviors mirrors several findings identified in the abusive leadership section   work characteristics are important antecedents and follower negative affective reactions are key outcomes  this is not surprising  given that followers of abusive supervisors often feel un  justly treated   daily leader follower interactions  methods and theory daily leadership studies on leader member exchange and other  types of dyadic interactions between leaders and followers highlight how leader follower interaction at the daily level has short term con  sequences for both leaders and followers  we found nine articles that studied daily leader follower interactions  seven used only follower measures and one used leader and follower measures  five of these studies are interval contingent sampling studies  three studies used event based sampling  and one study used a signal contingent method  almost all studies used affect emotion theories   or social theories   as their theoretical framework   consequences eight studies focused on the consequences of leader follower inter   actions  first  there are emotional and affective consequences for fol  lowers when they interact with their leader daily  for example  conflict episodes during the day with one s leader have been found to increase followers  daily negative affect    also  daily interactions with one s leader have been found to lead to fewer positive emotions than daily interactions with one s co workers    and negative work events involving one s leader create higher levels of follower negative emotions compared to negative events involving co  workers    finally  an event study of leader humor behaviors found that positive leader humor increased positive emotions among followers  while negative leader humor increased negative emotions among followers    daily leader  follower interactions have also been found to enhance follower be  longingness  which enhances follower vigor and decrease emotional exhaustion    and leader follower interactions studied at the event level show that resource contribution surplus leads to feelings of reciprocity and subsequent enhanced levels of work en  gagement    however  kudesia and reina   did not find daily interactions with trustworthy leaders to be significantly related to within person changes in follower mindfulness  finally  li et al    found that leaders are less likely to accept employee voice when they are more depleted   causes only one studied looked at the causes of leader behavior interac   tion  lam et al    found that for followers  daily voice directness was positively related to leader endorsement behavior  but only for individuals who had high voice credibility   daily leader supportive behaviors  methods and theory overall  we found   daily studies on supportive supervision  which  made it the most studied leader behavior in our review  these studies measured both general leader support as well as specific types of leader support such as coaching  mentoring  helping  family support  support  t k  kelemen  et al  the leadership quarterly             for creativity  etc  most used interval contingent methodology  and two studies used event sampling methodology  all but two of the studies only collected data from followers  and those studies collected data from both followers and leaders  these studies used a variety of theo  retical perspectives such as affective events theory    conserva  tions of resources theory    work home resource perspective    and job demands resources theory    however  five of these studies did not use an overall theoretical perspective   consequences in our review    studies explored the follower and leader con   sequences of supportive behaviors  most studies explored follower af  fective consequences to leader daily support  for example  amabile et al    found that daily leader reported supportive behaviors positively affected followers  daily perceptions of leader support and created a beneficial affective reaction for followers  which then posi  tively affected their day to day creativity levels  the daily use of em  pathy by one s leader was found to decrease followers  daily somatic complaints and strengthen the relation between followers  daily goal progress and their state positive affect    research also found that leader developmental feedback leads to follower positive affect  which then increases follower creativity on a within person basis     ford et al    found that daily leader helping led to more epi  sodic gratitude towards the organization  which increased the pre  valence of ocbs and decreased the prevalence of cwbs  also  day level coaching has been found to increase positive emotions and personal resources for followers who receive the coaching    and stocker et al    found that followers experienced higher levels of serenity on days that leaders showed appreciation for followers  taken together  these results show that daily leader support tends to enhance follower daily affect   however  in contrast to this general finding  two studies found that daily leader support hurt or had no effect on follower affect  jones and johnston   found that nurses who received managerial support after a negative incident were more likely to have a decrease in positive affect  and daily supervisor support was found to not interact with negative affect to influence perceived quality of care     in addition to affective reactions  daily leader support can cause followers to be more effective and creative  for example  daily super  visor support can stimulate followers to use their strengths more on the following day    also  daily supervisory career men  toring was found to be negatively associated with daily concern and positively associated with daily curiosity    finally  re  search has found that on days leaders both stimulate follower s ex  ploration of ideas and facilitate the exploitation of ideas    followers display more innovative behavior    the general trend across these studies high  lights how leaders  daily supportive behaviors tend to increase fol  lowers  daily positive affect and followers  daily creativity innovation   leader supportive behaviors also have consequences for the leader  lanaj and jennings   found that leaders experienced more nega  tive affect on days that they helped followers with personal problems  they also found that followers rated their leaders as less engaged on days that they had helped them with personal problems  this study by lanaj and jennings   explored an interesting within person rela  tion  showing a potential dark side to leader support  this likely would have been difficult to show at a between person level of analysis   causes only one study looked at the antecedents of supportive leader be   haviors  dollard and idris   found that espoused psychological safety climate by the organization led to an increase in daily enacted leader support   moderators in addition to exploring daily consequences    studies looked at  leader support as a moderator for various daily relations  for example  one study found that daily leader social support often weakens the positive relation between follower daily workload and emotional ex  haustion    daily supportive leadership also buffers the relation between follower work family conflict and follower end of  day cortisol levels    daily leader support also strengthens the negative relation between espoused psychological safety and daily emotional exhaustion    how  ever  blanco donoso et al    did not find that daily supervisor support buffers the negative effect that daily difficulties to regulate emotions at work had on emotional exhaustion  fatigue  and negative affect   several studies have shown how general supportive supervision moderates several types of daily work and home conflicts  for example  to et al    found that the daily positive relation between positive mood and creative process engagement is stronger when general leader support for creativity is high  general supportive supervision also minimizes the effects of daily work to family conflict to follower ne  gative affect    it reduces the positive effect daily family to work conflict has on follower daily counterproductive work behavior    aggression towards supervisors and co workers    and blood pressure    and it reduces the effect between follower daily workload and work family conflict    leader supportive behavior also reduces the relation between follower experiences of daily incivility and daily stress    as well as the relation be  tween negative customer experiences on employee positive affect    in aggregate  these studies provide considerable evi  dence that supportive leader behaviors can reduce the effects of fol  lower daily negative workplace stressors   daily moral leader behaviors  methods and theory moral approaches to leadership in this review include the following  three types of leadership  servant leadership  authentic leadership  and ethical leadership    each of these leadership theories taps into moral motifs of leader actions  we identified four studies that explored the daily occurrence and consequences of moral leadership behaviors  all but one focused on follower perceptions  and all used interval  contingent sampling methodology   consequences three studies explored the consequences of leader moral behaviors   daily ethical leadership was found to enhance follower daily engage  ment and subsequent helping behavior later in the day    however  the positive effects of daily ethical leadership beha  viors onto followers  work engagement are attenuated by the leader s previous day abusive behavior    daily servant lea  dership has been found to lead to an increase in next day follower goal attainment    moral leader behaviors also have consequences of the leader  one study found that daily au  thentic leadership behaviors do not deplete leaders  ego resources but enhance leaders  work engagement and decrease leaders  stress levels    thus  moral leader behaviors can be energizing for leaders as well   moderators finally  one studied explored moral leadership as a moderator  yagil  and medler liraz   found that the relation between followers  daily positive emotions and their levels of authentic self expression is stronger when they have a leader who displays more authentic lea  dership behaviors   t k  kelemen  et al  the leadership quarterly             surprisingly  only one study identified in our review explored daily servant leadership behaviors    this is unfortunate given that servant leadership  as a general behavior pat  tern  predicts more variance above and beyond transformational lea  dership than both ethical and authentic leadership     daily empowering leadership behaviors  methods and theory empowering leadership is an emerging leadership theory and in   cludes leader behaviors such as involving followers in decisions  dele  gating responsibilities to followers  and encouraging followers to take initiative    only two studies examined how empowering leadership as rated by followers can affect followers  daily outcomes  one study used interval contingent sampling with two measurement points a day    and one study used event sampling study     consequences first  schilpzand et al    showed that daily empowering lea   dership led followers to engage in more proactive goal setting the next day  which consequently enhanced followers  daily voice and risk  taking behaviors  these relations were strengthened when followers had a good night rest     moderators the second study found that general empowering leadership was a  cross level moderator that strengthens the relation between follower state promotion focus and creativity  empowering leadership also moderated the indirect effect between customer empowering behavior to creativity via state promotion focus    thus  em  powering leader behaviors can help facilitate follower daily proactivity and daily creativity   leader intervention  finally  two studies explored a daily leader behavioral intervention  in an experimental esm study  lanaj et al    showed that on days when leaders engaged in a positive self reflection exercise  they re  ported less energy depletion  which led to heightened work engagement for the leader and an increased sense of clout   and prosocial impact on others  this study suggests that positive self reflection behaviors can be an important mechanism to assist leaders in their day to day leadership  foulk et al    also conducted an experimental esm study and manipulated leader psychological power  psychological power was found to increase leader abusive behaviors   discussion  the number of daily studies that incorporate leadership has seen a rapid increase in the past few years  recent scholarly work on daily leadership behaviors has not only increased our collective knowledge of leadership but has also opened up opportunities avenues for new re  search  based on our discussion of the importance of studying daily leadership and review of the literature  we now provide recommenda  tions for future research  drawing upon our review we suggest ways scholars can provide more depth and breadth with daily leadership studies  in table    we provide a summary of our recommendations for future research   depth  time an important avenue for the future is to incorporate time when  studying daily leadership  very few studies in our review explicitly  addressed time in their theorizing  this is unfortunate because time is an important element in leadership that is too often overlooked    further  an important ad  vantage to daily studies is their ability to explain short term processes in leadership  and time is an important boundary condition for many of the theories used to understand leadership at the daily level such as stress strain theories  affect emotion theories  and theories of motiva  tion  some studies in our review would explore how leadership re  lationships occurred all in one day   while others explored how leadership relationships existed from one day to the next    for many studies  it was not clear why they focused on relationships only at a day level or at a day to day level  some studies did incorporate time as a part of their study  for example  qin et al    found that the leader personal benefit of improved recovery levels from abusive su  pervision is short lived for the leader and meier and gross   found that followers only retaliate incivility towards leaders  incivility when the follower reacts quickly   there are several different ways in which time may be included in leadership theories to get a better understanding of the dynamics of leadership behaviors  first  time   may be an explicit predictor of leadership behaviors  for example  could leaders be less likely to engage in transformational behaviors towards the end of the day  and perhaps engage in more abusive behaviors towards the end of the day due to fatigue or resource drain  or  what might be the consequence of daily leadership behaviors when leaders are called to work additional hours after the typical workday  finally  does the day of the week have implications for what types of behaviors leaders engage in or follower responses to leader behaviors  exploring daily leader behaviors by including time in dif  ferent ways opens up opportunities to answer different types of research questions that can enhance our understanding of the dynamics of lea  dership   another important way that future research may seek to incorporate time is to examine the time lagged effects of daily leadership behaviors  a few studies in our review explored time lagged effects in their studies    future scholars could explore additional time  lagged effects in daily leadership behaviors  since this is an important way to understand the causes and consequences of short term leader behaviors  for example  understanding how long leader behaviors last before they are diminished in value will be key for future scholarly work  specifically  what types of leadership behaviors have more en  during effects and which are more fleeting  for example  because  bad  is often more powerful than  good    it would be interesting to understand if destructive leader behaviors have longer lasting impacts on follower states compared to other constructive leader behaviors  this could also hold true for the antecedents to leadership behaviors   negative ante  cedents    may have a longer lasting effect than positive antecedents   on leader behavior   measure multiple leader behaviors leaders may exhibit many different types of leader behaviors and  daily studies are particularly well equipped to capture how different leader behaviors relate and coexist  general measures of leadership are often not precise enough and do not capture the transient nature of leader behaviors  daily studies that use a within person design can challenge and change how we view the relations between leader be  haviors  for example  breevaart et al    showed that leaders can be transformational  rewarding  and controlling all on the same day  in addition  lin et al    found that leaders who behave ethically on one day  are more likely to behave abusively the next day  as explained by moral licensing and ego depletion  however  in the studies in our review  few studies included multiple leader behaviors    and even less had more than two leader behaviors                more daily studies of leadership should include multiple types of leader behaviors because it can extend understanding of leader beha  viors that may be difficult to capture at a general level of analysis and can challenge how we understand leadership   relatedly  no study explored both daily and general leadership be  haviors together in one study  it would be interesting to see more stu  dies taking a multilevel approach to leadership   to see how daily processes affect general behaviors   and to understand how the two interact  for example  do followers whose leader is gen  erally inspiring and supportive react differently when their leader is laissez faire or abusive on a specific day compared to followers whose leader is generally uninspiring and unsupportive  one could argue that for the former group of followers  a daily deviation from the leader s general behavioral patterns is seen as a breach of trust  yet one could also argue that for this group of followers  leaders have some credits to temporarily deviate from their usual behavior   use discrete and precise measures when building leadership theory through daily studies  using more  precise and discrete measures of theoretical constructs can add rich detail to the process of leadership  when using more general measures of constructs    daily studies often fail to capitalize on their opportunity to explore unique and novel relationships  further  more general measures of theoretical constructs can often be effectively measured at a more general level of analysis  for example  when exploring affective events theory  rather than ex  ploring how daily constructive leader behaviors can cause follower daily positive affect scholars can be more precise  future scholars could explore how specific daily constructive leader behaviors   are linked with specific follower emotions  for example  is daily humble leadership more strongly related to follower feelings of gratitude whereas daily em  powering leadership is more strongly related to follower feelings of excitement  do different types of follower positive   emo  tions from their leaders  daily behaviors yield different follower  outcomes  or  do most follower positive   emotions caused by leaders generally lead to similar outcomes   task demands   is an  other example where future researchers can be more precise and measure discrete  daily task demands and how they relate to daily leadership  for example  how do daily meeting demands affect daily leadership behavior  or  how do follower specific demands relate to leader daily behaviors  rather than just exploring general daily de  mands  scholars have an opportunity to be more exact in their mea  surement  not only will this help build theory by exploring novel re  lationships but can also answer interesting questions and provide insights into leadership that have traditionally been overlooked   specificity of leader behaviors we encourage future researchers to be more specific about the  leader behavior studied  for example  instead of simply studying sup  portive leadership  future research should be more specific about how leaders are supportive of their followers on a daily basis  a number of studies in our review were specific about different types of leader supportive behavior measured   and this should continue in the future  also  transformational leader  ship has recently come into criticism for being too broad    however  transformational leadership was one of the most studied constructs in our review  we echo the re  commendation put forward by van knippenberg and sitkin   to study the dimensions of transformational leadership  and encourage future daily leadership research to study the dimensions of transfor  mational leadership  finally  future research could also drill down and find out which type of abusive supervision behaviors  when enacted on at the daily level  are most detrimental for followers   table   recommendations for future research   weakness directions for future research examples  depth few studies incorporated time into their hypothesizing and  models  future research could explicitly consider time into their theorizing and study design   research could explore how time of day affects leader behavior and seek to understand how long destructive and constructive leader behaviors affect followers at the daily level of analysis   a majority of studies focused on only one type of leader behavior  but daily studies can provide theoretical insight into how leader behaviors relate and coexist   more future research could examine multiple leader behaviors in a single study  research could explore how stable leadership behaviors interact with daily leadership behaviors to affect both leader and follower daily outcomes   many studies tested theories using general measures of theoretical constructs   future scholars should be more precise in their daily measures to test theory in unique ways   research could examine specific emotions when testing affective events theory or specific demands when testing job demands resources theory   some of the studies in our review looked at leader behaviors that were very broad    future research could do a better job of looking at more specific leadership behaviors   instead of studying supportive leadership  scholars could examine which types of supportive behaviors are most important   breadth few studies used leader interventions  researchers could utilize leader interventions  in their daily study designs  scholars could seek to understand the short term daily consequences of leadership interventions  such as gratitude or strengths based training  few studies used objective measures in their design  future research could better incorporate objective measures   into study designs   instead of relying on self report or other report data  scholars may incorporate objective measures such as daily exercise measured by a heart rate monitor on a fit bit  to understand how daily physical exercise might affect leader behavior   some leadership behaviors have been understudied at a daily level   future research could specifically examine these understudied areas   research could explore daily servant  humble  and laze faire leadership behaviors more extensively  no studies have specifically looked at how daily followership could affect leaders  emotions  attitudes  and behaviors   followers play an important role in crafting leadership  and research could explore how daily followership affects leaders   future research could explore how followership occurs on a daily basis   studies in our review primarily relied upon mems to test their hypotheses   researchers should be aware of the different ways to model clustered data and assure that they are correctly modeling their data   future research could be more explicit about how they model their data and make sure that they explain how they meet the necessary assumptions for the model that they use   t k  kelemen  et al  the leadership quarterly             breadth  types of leader behaviors overall  previous leadership research has looked at a wide array of  leader behaviors  however  there are still some behaviors that have been understudied by daily leadership scholars  based on our review of the literature  we encourage scholars to broaden the spectrum of lea  dership behaviors studied in a daily fashion  for example  humble leadership has been gaining popularity in recent years    but no previous study has focused on daily humble leadership   furthermore  we did not find any daily study on laissez faire lea  dership  laissez faire leadership occurs when leaders do not interfere with their followers  but rather withdraw themselves from the work  place  whereas some scholars consider laissez faire a type of non lea  dership  others see laissez faire as a form of destructive leadership    future work could study laissez faire leadership on a daily level of analysis  this research could give some insights into the discussion of laissez faire leadership  taking into account the reasons why leaders withdraw themselves from the workplace  for example  could it be an effective strategy to withdraw oneself from the workplace when facing high work demands  rather than engaging with followers with the risk of having a fallout  and does it make a difference whether leaders are generally engaging   and how many days leaders withdraw themselves from the workplace  future research is needed to answer these  and other  interesting questions regarding different daily leadership behaviors   followership and followers daily studies could also help scholars study followership and how it  alters leader behavior on a daily basis  no studies in our review ex  plored daily followership but followership likely plays an important role in a leader s daily behavior  for example  scholars may explore how followers  leader directed citizenship behavior or proactive behavior may elicit positive types of leader behaviors  such as transformational leader behaviors  scholars may also explore  from a moral licensing perspective  how follower positive behavior could create moral credits for a leader that might increase future negative leader behaviors   relatedly  prior research has highlighted the benefits of leaders adjusting their leadership behaviors to the needs of their followers    indeed  one of the articles in our review examined how the daily fit between transformational leadership needed and received leads to follower positive affect and subsequent job satisfaction    however  each follower may have different needs  and fre  quently adjusting behavior may be cognitively and emotionally draining for leaders  future daily leadership studies could look at both the benefits and the downsides to leaders frequently changing their types of behaviors throughout the day when interacting with different followers   leader interventions the study of daily leadership behaviors also lends itself to under   stand the implications leadership interventions and training have for leaders in the short term  for example  lanaj et al    examined how leader reflection could positively influence the leader s daily be  haviors  organizations spend millions of dollars each year on leadership development  understanding effective leader interventions that im  prove daily leadership behaviors has important implications for prac  titioners  further  understanding the means by which a leader can alter their leader behaviors will have important implications for both fol  lowers and organizations alike  for example  scholars might explore how a leader gratitude intervention or strengths based training can impact a leader s daily leadership behavior  research that can highlight practical interventions  trainings  or resources that improve daily leader  behaviors will be an important way in which daily studies of leadership can make academic leadership studies more applicable to organiza  tions   when measuring the effect interventions have on leader behaviors  scholars could also use a daily esm before the intervention and then several months after the intervention    this type of study design would allow scholars to utilize the benefits of esm studies  but would also better measure the longer term effectiveness of the in  tervention  in a similar vein  multiple esm studies could be used over a longer period of time in order to get a more detailed understanding of how leadership processes and leadership development evolve over time   objective measures although objective data is sometimes used in daily leadership stu   dies  most of the studies still use self reports to gather information on private feelings that are difficult for others to assess  daily esm studies do not resolve the methodological disadvantages of self reports  but they do minimize many of the concerns  global self reports are more strongly influenced by memory bias because when followers are asked to think back over the last months or report general feelings about an event  their answers often reflect general beliefs or attitudes    because of its proxi  mity to the events  esm helps reduce memory and estimation problems  however  also due to its proximity  esm can increase affective bias  therefore  future research on daily leadership behaviors could benefit from the inclusion of more objective measures in combination with subjective measures   barnes et al     almeida et al     and shockley and allen   are all examples of articles that used both objective and sub  jective measures in their studies  barnes et al    included a mea  sure of sleep duration  however  new methodologies such as sleep tracking devices and location trackers   now allow for even more objective context measures    almeida et al    used daily saliva samples to measure cortisol levels  shockley and allen   used wristwatches to measure heart rate and blood pressure throughout the day  pairing subjective mea  sures with daily objective measures whenever possible and suitable  would enhance the quality of daily leadership studies and the quality of leadership research in general  for example  future studies could use car tracking devices to track how leader induced follower aggression affects subordinates  driving behavior on their commute home  or fu  ture work may explore how physical exercise may be an important antecedent to constructive leader behaviors  with sleep  while prior research has examined how lack of sleep leads to abusive supervision    future studies could look at whether abusive su  pervision increases difficulties for followers to fall asleep due to rumi  nation  finally  while it would be difficult to get objective measures of daily job performance in many jobs  there are some jobs that have objective  daily job performance measures   that could be used in conjunction with daily studies of leadership   modeling of data studying daily life   inherently results in hierarchical  or clustered  data    recently  mcneish and kelley   as well as antonakis  bastardoz  and rÃ¶nkkÃ¶   showed that the ways in which clustered data are modeled is highly dependent on the discipline in which the study is conducted  specifically  re  searchers in the field of economics primarily use fixed effects models    and some scholars have suggested that this is the  gold stan  dard  for modeling clustered data    whereas mixed effects models           mcneish   kelley     are more commonly used in the fields of psychology and management  as these authors rightfully note  rather than co existing  it is important that both fields learn from one another to advance scientific practice   one major benefit of mems is that they can incorporate both level   and level   effects    whereas fems can only incorporate level    effects and account for the clustered nature of the data using dummy codes  yet  mem s require that the random effects assumption   is met  meaning that the predictor variables do not covary with the random effects  if this assumption is violated  it means that estimates may be biased due to unmodeled variables at the second level    antonakis et al    provide an overview of the possibilities to test the random effects assumption     one way to bridge the gap between mems and fems   to avoid endogeneity and at the same time model level   effects   is to use a within between specification of a mixed effects model    these models include the cluster means of group  mean centered level   predictors as level   predictors and as such separate the estimation of within  and between cluster effects  we en  courage future leadership scholars  particularly those who conduct daily studies of leadership  to consider the  advantages of all the above mentioned models and make a conscious decision about how to best analyze their data  antonakis et al    provide a very useful decision chart that may help researchers to decide what type of model is appropriate to test their multilevel models depending on the type of effects that are of interest as well as the random effects assumption   conclusion  this review has highlighted previous research that has examined the daily causes and consequences of leadership behaviors  by reviewing the theoretical  behavioral  and methodological trends in daily leader  ship research we hope that our review will provide a basis for best practices that can be utilized as a reference for those wishing to ex  amine daily leadership behaviors  while prior leadership research at the daily level has begun to uncover and expand our understanding of leadership  we have highlighted a number of areas for future scholarly work  in so doing  we hope that future studies of daily leadership be  haviors can extend our breadth and expound our depth of our under  standing of daily leadership   references    almeida  d  m   davis  k  d   lee  s   lawson  k  m   walter  k  n     moen  p     supervisor support

s t r a c t  digital technologies are changing the nature of teamwork in ways that have important implications for lea  dership  though conceptually rich and multi disciplinary  much of the burgeoning work on technology has not been fully integrated into the leadership literature  to fill this gap  we organize existing work on leadership and technology  outlining four perspectives    technology as context    technology as sociomaterial    tech  nology as creation medium  and   technology as teammate  each technology perspective makes assumptions about how technologies affect teams and the needs for team leadership  within each perspective  we detail current work on leading teams  this section takes us from virtual teams to new vistas posed by leading online communities  crowds  peer production groups  flash teams  human robot teams  and human artificial in  telligence teams  we identify   leadership implications arising from the ways digital technologies affect or  ganizing  we then leverage our review to identify directions for future leadership research and practice   introduction  the digital age has changed the nature of work in ways that were unimaginable even a decade ago    technological advances have shifted many people from working inside formal organizations to working as loosely connected members of a larger community  such as the virtual office employees across major industries    technological advances have given rise to the gig economy  where individuals sell their services directly to the market    crowd workers contract their time and skills on an as needed basis on e  commerce sites like upwork  an online platform that  expertly matches professionals and agencies to businesses seeking specialized talent     and mturk  a  crowdsourcing marketplace that makes it easier for individuals and businesses to outsource their processes and jobs to a distributed workforce who can perform these tasks virtually     there are many ways digital technologies are trans  forming the nature of work  the permeation of digital technologies is not changing the widespread organization of work into teams  but it is changing the nature of teamwork  consider these examples   â¢ organizations from netflix to nasa regularly use online tourna  ments to source innovation     â¢ internet sites like upwork allow fortune   companies to hire freelancers from around the world to perform skilled and specialized work    â¢ the free online encyclopedia wikipedia is maintained by volunteers who produce a product with comparable accuracy to traditional encyclopedias    â¢ robots now routinely assist physicians and nurses during a wide range of surgeries     each example describes work that has been enhanced in some way through advances in computing  all four examples involve teams per  forming work that has and continues to change with advances in digital tools  in the cases of upwork and wikipedia  the internet has enabled a new kind of organization  the online community  where relationships are informal and participation is voluntary  although contributions to wikipedia are unpaid  contributions to upwork are paid at a negotiated rate  on upwork  individuals can create a team project   and staff the team with contractors located around the world  traditional organizations like netflix and nasa are leveraging these advances to help them innovate  all four examples demonstrate the exciting ways technology is transforming the basic nature of teamwork     this fundamental transformation of teamwork vis a vis technology has important implications for leadership  teams are using an    received   november    received in revised form   december    accepted   december    â corresponding author at  department of communication studies    campus drive  northwestern university  evanston  il    united states of america  e mail address        the leadership quarterly        available online   january        Â©   elsevier inc  all rights reserved   t                  increasingly sophisticated array of technologies to work together   re  latively basic messaging and video conferencing systems have been joined by enterprise social media   and colla  borative editing suites    though technologies have been shifting the landscape of teams for some time  these shifts are becoming more transformative  technologies have  for some time  enabled individuals to collaborate in teams over great dis  tances  they are now shaping who comes together in teams and al  lowing teams to scale up in much larger networks of teams  if the  th century saw the rise of self managing work teams    the  st century introduces us to teams with crowd workers  paid or unpaid workers who organize via the internet  operate outside formal organizations  and may never meet in person     technologies are also creating new kinds of team members  whereas most basic definitions of teams begin with  two or more in  dividuals     the digital age invites organiza  tional scholars to rethink what constitutes a team member  rapid ad  vances in robotics   and artificial intelligence   are introducing technologies to teams as autonomous team members  although robots and algorithms have long been replacing some individuals   and augmenting the capabilities of others    we are fast approaching a time when autonomous agents are motivated beings working alongside their human counterparts   the popular press is replete with futuristic thinking on the changing nature of work    and there is great demand for managerial training to equip leaders for the digital age  how managers leverage ai may well be the major differentiator between those who succeed and those who fail at leading in the age of ai   the advances of brilliant machines will astound us  but they will transform the lives of senior executives only if managerial advances enable them to     the success of teams in settings that span the many industries being transformed by technology   healthcare  entrepreneurship  space exploration  entertainment   hinges on con  current advances in leadership   the central premise of this review is that the digital transformation of work makes leadership even more critical to team effectiveness in a variety of ways  furthermore  how we view technology s role in teams creates different implications for leadership  in order to more con  cretely understand the leadership implications of technologies  we re  viewed the research on team leadership as it relates to digital tech  nology  in doing so  we identified four perspectives on the role of technology in teams  these four perspectives are depicted in fig     along with an approximate timeline of when we started to see research reflective of each technology view  each of these views makes a distinct core assertion about the role of leadership in supporting teamwork   there have been a number of excellent recent reviews on team leadership    though there has not been a review explicitly focused on the implications of technology for team leadership  given the changes in teamwork described in our opening  such a review is sorely needed to highlight the specific ways that technology can condition  create  and shape team leadership  the central aim of our review is to bring digital technology more clearly into focus in order to understand the leader  ship implications of leading in the digital age   our review juxtaposes technology and team leadership  we review key findings from technology rich domains as they relate to team lea  dership in order to highlight the leadership implications stemming from each technology perspective  in doing so  we unveil new insights about leading teams in an age of unprecedented technological transformation  our primary contributions are twofold   fig    previews the key components of our review  in the center  we  depict the four perspectives on digital technology we identified in our review  we label these  digital technology as a team context  digital technology as sociomaterial team practices  digital technology as team creation medium  and digital technology as a teammate  we also note the approximate timeframe when prominent theorizing about technol  ogies began to adopt each of the four perspectives included in our re  view  along the bottom of fig    we have listed some examples of the terms used in research examining the ways emerging technologies af  fect teams  starting from the left  we list one of the earliest terms  computer supported groups   though we begin our review in earnest after the turn of the century  we included this term for completeness as this was a period that ignited interest in teams and technology  around the turn of the century  substantial attention was paid to  virtual teams  whose members used technologies to collaborate remotely  on the bottom of fig    we have listed some examples of the focal technologies that scholars had in mind as they studied technology and teams  the far right of the figure denotes the leadership findings and implications that comprise the bulk of our review  for each technology perspective  we review the research that relates to team leadership  summarizing the leadership implications that come into focus when we take on each of the four technology perspectives  we present the timeline as a guide for understanding the loose temporal associations between theorizing on team leadership  technology  and emerging team forms  though we note that our review of findings does not proceed chronologically  ra  ther we organized findings according to the technology perspective reflected in the study  for each technology perspective  we review findings as they relate to team leadership   research on team leadership generally emphasizes two dimensions  leadership functions and leadership forms  the first dimension is team leadership functions    this dimension highlights the need for leaders to ensure the core needs of the team are satisfied  with the ultimate aim of fostering team ef  fectiveness     though taxonomies differ  most encompass the need for teams to develop strong affective emergent states like trust and cohesion  the need to develop cognitive emergent states like shared mental models and transactive memory systems  and the need to enact behavioral integration processes  leader  ship forms describe the pattern or topology of how leadership is carried out by the team  some common team leadership forms include hier  archical  shared  distributed  and rotated leadership    research shows collective forms of leadership are more beneficial than hierarchical forms in promoting team effectiveness     based on these two dimensions  team leadership can be thought of as actions taken by one or more team members to ensure that team needs are being met  zaccaro et al    summarize a number of team leadership actions  recognizing and constructing team problems  gen  erating  planning  and implementing solutions to those problems  and coordinating and monitoring the implementation of those solutions  together  leadership functions and forms provide a useful framework for understanding leadership in the digital age   we review the findings related to team leadership that explicitly focus on some aspect of digital technologies  we began our review by searching for articles with keywords such as  leader  and  technology   we knew that our literature search would need to take place across disciplines as the research on leadership and technology is cross dis  ciplinary and much of the human technology interaction work is in fact occurring in disciplines other than the organizational sciences  thus  we also skimmed the abstracts of articles with the terms  group    team    collective   and other group related terms to see how other disciplines might be talking and thinking about team leadership and technology  in reviewing these studies  we saw evidence of four perspectives on technology that serve as the major categories of our review   the first two perspectives are prevalent in technology studies  technology as context views technology and social practices as distinct  l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             entities  the technology is a situational context that creates conditions that affect social practices  the second view  technology as sociomaterial  explores  the ways that  a technology s  physical and or digital mate  rials are arranged into particular forms that endure across differences in place and time     and views material aspects of technology and social practices as mutually dependent ensembles such that there is  an inherent inseparability between the technical and the social     most current work on team leadership takes one of these two perspectives on technology   the third perspective  technology as team creation medium  explores the ways that technology platforms are shaping who forms teams and how they form them  research in this area focuses on the role of technology in the initial formation and later reformation of teams  the prevalence of large online communities and new ways of organizing are expanding the role of team leaders  and in some cases  replacing leader activities with algorithmic control  a fourth perspective is emerging in which technology is a motivated social being  technology as teammate  with the rise in automation in our everyday lives  we are becoming dependent on our technological teammates at home and at the office  intelligent machines are helping us pilot our airplanes  select new employees  and crunch numbers in order to make organizational steering decisions  just to name a few examples  this perspective will influence how leaders manage team members  both humans and in  telligent agents  and has important ethical considerations for leaders as this perspective of teaming becomes increasingly prevalent in our or  ganizations  in the next section  we review scholarship on digital technologies and team leadership in order to foster greater linkages between the two and to highlight the key leadership implications sug  gested by work in each domain   a review of technology and team leadership  table   provides a useful guide for the review that follows  we summarize each of the four technology perspectives and their im  plications for leadership  table   allows us to compare and contrast the perspectives in terms of    how digital technologies relate to team  work and   the leadership needs created by technology when viewed from each perspective  we begin by considering research conducted from the first technology perspective   technology as context  the first area of research on technology and organizing considers technology as team context  this view holds that technology has fixed features that set up the context in which team processes take place    according to this view  when teams use digital technologies to interact with one another  the technology is an important aspect of the leadership situation  according to this view  we would understand a distributed team convening via videoconference by looking separately at the team process behavior on the one hand and the features of the video conference system   on the other  in this view  technology is separate from the team  there are teams who use technology and those who do not  there are teams who use information rich technologies and those who use less rich tools  technology as context considers technology as having features that determine important aspects of the leadership si  tuation   the context perspective of technology in teams grows out of a long  standing view of teamwork and leadership as situated in context  reviews of context in psychological leadership research   demonstrate a long history of context as a consideration in the study of teams and leadership  one area of research that took a technology as context perspective in its examination of leadership is that of e lea  dership    e lea  dership theorizes the leadership needs of those  who conduct many of the processes of leadership largely through electronic channels  to begin to study leadership in virtually collaborating teams     other work advocates the need for greater attention to context in leadership research in general    johns sug  gests that context is often mishandled in organizational behavior re  search and offers useful dimensions through which to understand lea  dership in context  the omnibus context and the discrete context  the omnibus context is the overarching context in which leadership occurs and represents the  who  where  when  and why  of the context  the discrete context represents the task  social  and physical context of the team  the omnibus context encompasses the discrete context  these  fig     four perspectives on digital technology with implications for leading teams   l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             two dimensions of context are proposed to help scholars think about how their study of context and the generalization of contextual findings can occur in a more rigorous and structured way  in thinking about teams in the digital age  new technologies influencing leadership pro  cesses are part of the larger   omnibus  context  the  who  where  when  and why  of the context   similar to johns  dimensions of organizational context  morgeson and colleagues suggest a model for understanding team leadership functions in which one must understand the context of the team  the organization  and the environment in order to understand leadership processes and subsequent team effectiveness    oc   builds directly on the johns   frame  work for understanding organizational context and proposes a frame  work for understanding leadership and team context  oc proposes that the omnibus and discrete contexts interact with leadership influencing processes   and leadership outcomes    in sum  technology as context stems from a popular and well developed perspective of research on the context of leadership in general   much of this work on technology as context uses the notion of team virtuality  team virtuality is comprised of     the extent to which team members use virtual tools to coordinate and execute team processes    the amount of informational value provided by such tools  and   the synchronicity of team member virtual interaction     another definition of virtuality includes geo  graphic dispersion  electronic dependence  structural dynamism  and national diversity    scholarship on virtuality holds technology as having fixed objective properties that constitute the context in which leadership occurs  these definitions of virtuality serve to underscore the emphasis of technology as a piece of the environment in which organizing occurs  which is core to work taking viewing technology as a context for teamwork   work examining technology as a context in teams began with the study of computer supported work groups in the   s    the work on com  puter supported work groups morphed into what we know of today as  virtual teams     also sometimes referred to as global virtual or globally distributed teams as well    virtual teams are defined as  groups of geographically and or organizationally dispersed coworkers that are assembled using a combination of telecommunica  tions and information technologies to accomplish an organizational task     as a guide  table   includes a list of definitions for some of the various labels ap  plied to technology enabled teams   from a technology as context perspective  we see that leadership requires unique considerations on the part of the leader in technolo  gically enabled contexts    there is a  consensus among scholars that virtual teams are more difficult to lead than face to face teams     team  leadership needs to compensate for the challenges created by virtual collaboration  difficulties in leading such teams relate to both leader  ship functions and leadership forms   a large body of research has examined leadership functions in teams with technology taken as a context  specifically  research has focused on the challenges leaders face specific to team affective processes  such as relationship building  which fosters team states such as team cohe  sion and team trust    face to face teams have been shown to have higher levels of cohesion than virtual teams    and teams using chat have lower levels of cohesion compared to face to face teams and videoconferencing teams    computer mediated teams are also generally less satisfied in their team interactions than face to face teams    trust is integral to virtual team functioning  but is also difficult to form virtually     research has also tackled the issue of team behavioral processes in technology as a context  including communication and coordination    communication in virtual teams can be challen  ging    virtual teams communicate through multiple different channels  often including both instant messaging through an enterprise social media platform and video conferencing  sometimes virtual team members can actually see the faces of their team members  and other times  virtual team members only have text to go off of to interpret a team member s meaning behind their words  nonverbal communication is a primary challenge for communication in virtual teams    likewise  utilizing technology for coordination of virtual team members can pose a challenge  virtual team members may come from different time zones so the physical coordination of work can become asynchronous from one another  making coordination challenging    virtual team members also may encounter cultural differences  especially global virtual teams  which may mean team members have different preferences and work styles     finally  research has investigated team cognitive processes in technology as a context  cognitive processes are especially difficult to develop in teams whose members rarely if ever meet in person  however  formation of transactive memory systems in virtual teams is essential to effective team task performance  research on knowledge coordination in virtual teams has shown that virtual teams form mental maps of member s knowledge  but that these mental maps   transactive memory systems   take a considerable amount of time to form     research has found that leaders play an integral role in virtual team functioning  and virtual team leaders can help to tackle challenges caused by the virtuality of their teams through a few different means    research has demonstrated that leaders in virtual teams are critical in encouraging positive team interactions and redu  cing negative team interactions  such as team conflict           leidner    garrison      virtual team leaders can help facilitate team norms for how the team will go about communicating and co  ordinating with one another    clearly establishing norms for communication and coordination can help to establish trust among team members by providing clear ex  pectations for themselves and others  fostering high quality commu  nication can help increase trust in virtual teams    high quality communication has been shown to be pre  dictive of who emerges as a leader in virtual teams    leaders that help to foster interpersonal communication as opposed to more task focused communication can help increase cohesion and trust in virtual teams    when virtual teams support more social com  munication among team members  virtual teams report higher levels of trust   and interpersonal relationships    interestingly  one study found that if virtual team member actions are made more visible to the rest of the team  then the effects of virtuality on trust may be lessened compared to teams with less visible team member actions     leaders can also help to overcome the challenges of virtual teaming through cultivating psychological safety among team members  psychological safety is the shared belief that the team is an accepting place for taking interpersonal risks  making mistakes is an accepted part of learning  and team members encourage each other to speak up    high levels of psychological safety have been shown to help mitigate the challenges of working and leading in virtual teams such that communication and coordination is less challenging in a psychologically safe environment     finally  some styles of leadership are more conducive than others in fostering productive teamwork in virtual teams  transformational lea  dership in virtual teams was associated with higher team performance  team satisfaction  and team motivation     in sum  leaders may be able to help virtual teams overcome the challenges of virtuality by encouraging visible  high quality  socially  oriented communication in order to help build trust and cohesion among virtual team members  leaders can also help to encourage psychological safety among team members to help with virtual team communication and coordination  finally  transformational leadership behaviors may be more beneficial than transactional behaviors in overcoming the challenges faced by virtual teams   taken together  these findings summarize ways that team leader  ship meets team needs when team members are working remotely largely through and with digital technologies  the key assumption about leading teams from this technology perspective is that technology features determine important aspects of the leadership situation  we summarize the findings reviewed in this section as suggesting the  following leadership implication   leadership implication     team leaders need to compensate for the challenges that virtual teams face in developing affective and cognitive states and enacting team processes  challenges that are created by virtual collaboration     a second area for leadership research related to our review of re  search examining technology as a context examines leadership forms  extant research on leadership in teams from the technology as context perspective suggests that team leadership benefits from sharing lea  dership among team members  research on leadership forms in virtual teams suggests that distributing leadership across multiple members of the virtual team rather than a single member is a more effective and efficient leadership structure in many virtual team settings    this is because placing all leadership responsibility on a single virtual team member requires more time and effort than your average face to face team due to the technological tools that must be used in order to complete typical leadership activities  such as mo  tivation and direction setting    in fact  mul  tiple studies have observed that the inherent structures and collabora  tive tendencies within virtual teams cause leadership behaviors to emerge informally from a number of team members rather than from any officially appointed leader    the observation from these studies is that shared leadership is better than hierarchical leadership for helping virtual teams develop needed affective and cognitive states and enact team processes   leadership implication     shared leadership forms are better than vertical forms for helping virtual teams develop functional affective and cognitive states and enact team processes   technology as sociomaterial  a second body of work takes a different view of technology  work that adopts a technology as sociomaterial team practices perspective considers the technology practices that teams develop as they en  counter material aspects of digital technologies    technology practices come about when team members  intentions  a desire to do something  meet features of digital technologies  an ability to do something using a feature of technology  the earliest work on teams to reflect this technology perspective emerged from structuration which is a concept that  acknowledges the active role of human agency in social systems     the idea of structuration evolved into the area of research examining adaptive structuration theory  adaptive structuration theory is proposed as a  framework for studying variations in organization change that occur as advanced  table   definitions of exemplar technology enabled team types   entity definition exemplar citation   computer supported work groups two or more people who communicate

decostanza et al      l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             technologies are used     adaptive structuration explains that a technology s features can serve very dif  ferent functions to a team  team members develop practices and use technologies in ways that meet their needs  the same team may use the same technology differently at different times as their needs change  likewise  different teams might use the same technology in different ways  in this way  the sociomaterial perspective examines technology and teams as mutually dependent ensembles   and leads us to explore  the development or use of materials and forms  in teams     the view of technology as mutually intertwined with social prac  tices is often examined from a technology affordance perspective  the core idea of affordances originated from james gibson s gestalt psy  chology thinking that objects do not have inherent functions    rather a function is what comes about when an individual rea  lizes that an object can be used for something  it is neither the person nor the object  separately  that explains the pleasure of resting on a tree stump  rather it is the moment when the tired person sees the flatness of the stump and decides to sit  in this example  fatigue creates the per  son s motivation to rest and the stump s flatness is a material property that can enable rest  flatness has afforded the weary hiker a means to rest  though not always tactile  digital technologies nonetheless have properties that inspire uses as well  many of these have been described and characterized as technology affordances   consider the association affordance    many team processes require that team members form a mental under  standing of who holds what viewpoint  who creates which products or ideas  or who supports or opposes whom  the team process of mon  itoring and backup behavior   implies that team members can observe one another s work and intervene when the work is subpar in order to ensure that team performance does not suffer  many programmed features that are built into digital technolo  gies afford team members the ability to make these associations  as an example  consider any project management software   that has members create a profile with their name and photo  when the member posts something  the post appears next to their name and photo  a team member who wants to go back and re  view what has been posted related to a particular deliverable could use the search function to see who has contributed what    an affordance perspective recognizes how the materiality of an object favors  shapes  or invites  and at the same time constrains  a set of specific uses     zammuto and colleagues use the concept of affordances to  capture the interplay between it and organization  to represent the idea that  new combinations of technology and organizational features continually create possibilities that affect organizational form and function     zammuto et al    suggested five possible af  fordances offered by organizational technologies  work processes vi  sualization  real time product and service innovation  virtual colla  boration  collaboration with many people at once  and virtual reality   as an example of how the sociomaterial view considers the joint confluence of human intentions and material aspects of technology  consider a technology called ambit  ambit   is a software tool that monitors team conversations in realtime and provides instant feedback on the percentage of air time captured by each team member during a discussion  this feature may serve as a shared leadership af  fordance  enabling the group to adjust and rebalance conversation to gain input from soft spoken members  another group may see this in  formation differently  instead using the tool to determine the deviant whose pattern of communication is blocking the passage of an im  portant initiative  importantly  the technology has features  but the way these features are perceived and appropriated by the team can vary widely   with the exception of poole and desanctis  adaptive structuration theory  work viewing technology from a sociomaterial lens proliferated in the   s alongside the spread of online communities   and crowds    online communities and crowds are in  terrelated terms  the former is used to describe a virtual space  where people come together with others to converse  or to exchange in  formation or other resources     organi  zational scholars exploring online communities study the shared iden  tity that develops and connect members  crowds  on the other hand  are more deliberative and closer to resembling work teams  crowds include people who self organize online around a common purpose  typically that purpose was  once performed by employees and is now outsourced to a network  of people through an  open call  for participation    crowds often form within online communities  online commu  nities and crowds can form within traditional organizations or outside formal organizations  an example of the latter is innocentive    an open innovation platform where organizations post challenges offering rewards to solvers who need not be employees of the sponsoring organization   if we adopt a technology as sociomaterial view then we see the ways in which team leadership comes about and is enacted as team needs meet technological materiality  leaders and team members have agency in determining how technologies are used to meet team needs  research has explored the ways in which the  imbrication of humans and material agencies    can explain leadership functions and forms   research taking a sociomaterial view of technology has explored the ways in which leadership functions come about in tandem with mate  rial aspects of digital technologies    studies have identified practices that meet affective team needs  for instance  in a study of three virtual investing related communities  members with no formal role took on the role of conflict mediators  when a disagreement between two individuals became personal and destructive     members also stepped forward to motivate and direct the group  though rarely the initiator of the idea  idea champions  en  sure that the kernel of the idea was maintained and evolved through the discussion     a final example of how informal leadership is used to build affective attachment is metavoicing  which occurs when online community members react to one another s presence in the online community  their profile  con  tributed content  or other activities     studies also suggest leaders help online communities and crowds to meet their cognitive process related group needs  for example  quali  tative studies observed the role of the shaper in an online community  the shaper is someone who helps to organize diverse contributions into a coherent message    the shaper self nominates to take on the work of intellectually integrating contributions  another leadership act aimed at team cognition is called channeling participation  channeling participa  tion occurs when members  create a narrative that helps keep fluid participants informed of the state of the knowledge  with this narrative having a necessary duality between a front narrative for general public consumption and a back narrative to air the differences and emotions created by the tensions      quite a few studies have explored leadership that behaviorally in  tegrates team members  ideas and actions  one set of activities is la  beled engendering roles in the moment  this occurs when observing  a perceived state of the community  coupled with a perceived self effi  cacy that a particular contribution might be helpful to the community    these roles are not enacted because the participant is a member of a core group or asserts leadership authority instead    the participant appears to be enacting a self defined role as a mediator   unmasker   organizer  or supporter   that sustains collaboration    another leadership act enabling behavioral integration in online communities is dynamically changing boundaries  a strategy  l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             used by online community members to  discourage or encourage cer  tain resources into and out of the communities at certain times      lastly  leaders in online communities enable adaptive behavioral responses among contributors  members of online communities evolve technology affordances in ways that are embedded by  and become embedded into  iteratively enhanced social norms   these iterations help the oc to socially and technically automate responses to tensions so that the community does not unravel     evolving technology affordances is a strategy for teams to remain adaptive in response to changes   taken together  the work on leadership functions taking a socio  material view of technology suggests ways that features of technology can enable team members to lead the development of needed affective and cognitive team states and behavioral team processes  the key as  sumption about leading teams from this technology perspective is that material features of technology and behavioral intentions jointly create affordances for leading and collaborating in teams  the findings re  viewed in this section can be summarized with the following leadership implication   leadership implication     team leaders can shape technology practices in order to foster the development of functional affective and cognitive states and enactment of team processes   research adopting a technology as sociomaterial perspective also speaks to the second dimension of team leadership  forms  desanctis and poole   pointed out that technology plays an important role in shaping team status hierarchies  material aspects of technological tools can determine  the likelihood of leadership emerging when the tech  nology is used  whether a leader is more likely or less likely to emerge  or whether there will be equal participation versus domination by some members      research on online communities and crowds emphasizes the im  portance of emergent  informal leadership that is often shared or ro  tated among community members  leadership in online communities and crowds tends to shift among members  and leadership authority has been observed as  fleeting in such communities     in fact  online communities have even been seen as resisting formal leadership from those developing and maintaining the platforms    overall  the inherent structure of online communities and crowds lends to a more shared  informally emergent leadership structure in terms of the form in which leadership takes in such teaming types  these findings emphasize that technological affordances can af  fect the form of leadership that emerges in teams  and also the degree to which leadership is stable or fluid  this suggests the following leader  ship implication   leadership implication     team technology practices can shape the emergence of team leadership structures  and the stability versus fluidity of team leadership structures   technology as creation medium  a third area of research takes another perspective of technology  work adopting a technology as team creation medium perspective ex  plores the ways that technology platforms are shaping who forms teams and how they do it    this research explicitly focuses on the role of technology in the initial formation and later reformation of teams through boundary management practices  the technology as creation medium perspective views technology as creating new opportunities for team leadership  expanding the ways leaders can lead teams  studies conducted from a technology as creation medium perspective also mark a shift in thinking about technologies and teams insofar as studies il  lustrate ways that the technologies themselves can serve all or at least parts of the leadership role   the context and sociomaterial perspectives have in common that  they both explain how technology meets traditional team leadership functions like supporting affective and cognitive states and team pro  cess behavior  the context view highlights ways that technology makes each of these team needs more pressing  requiring leaders to compen  sate for technology induced challenges  the sociomaterial view ex  plores technology practices in teams and suggests the kinds of practices that can provide needed leadership functions and the ways technology features shape team leadership forms  in the technology as creation medium perspective  the focus shifts to new leadership functions and leadership behaviors that are made possible with emerging technolo  gies  and in some cases  to ways in which these functions can be ac  complished by the technology as a leadership substitute  this per  spective has flourished in the  st century as the internet has become widely accessible to larger audiences around the world  the larger the population of internet users  the larger the pool becomes that could potentially contribute to projects created through technology that was not possible prior to the availability of large  diverse populations of potential contributors   one group of studies on technology as a creation medium is work on peer production groups  the quintessential example being the teams who come together to curate pages in the online encyclopedia wikipedia  peer production groups are  large scale  collaborative and primarily voluntary models of production in some of the most in  novative and competitive sectors of information and technology     some examples of peer production groups include open source software teams who rapidly self assemble online in response to bugs in computer code    citizen science teams who self assemble to help classify and label stars in the galaxy    and open innovation teams  where  people from different organizations work together to develop new products  services  or markets     most of the pages on the online en  cyclopedia wikipedia com are written and maintained by a fluid core team of individuals who monitor and update the content  peer pro  duction groups  like those managing wikipedia articles    consist of individuals who come together to  harness the collaborative efforts of many individuals in order to create artifacts of lasting value     in peer production examples such as the creation and maintenance of the online open encyclopedia wiki  pedia or the linux operating system    individuals vo  luntarily join a cause or project because of some intrinsic value of the project toward that person    team collaboration pro  cesses among the groups working on the peer production project are not organized in any particular way and are often only acknowledged through peer production related forums or chat boards   another group of studies comes from work on flash teams  flash teams come together on portals like upwork com that allow individuals to lead the formation and maintenance of a team of experts to accom  plish specific goals  upwork is a marketplace for professional workers that allows individuals to rapidly hire experts and supports their col  laboration to accomplish a defined task  flash teams provide a tech  nological  framework for dynamically assembling and managing paid experts from the crowd     for example  one might decide to convene a  flash team  using the software platform upwork    flash teams provide an effective way to accomplish a variety of tasks ranging from creative design to engineering projects    individuals who participate in these teams have specialized skills and see new oppor  tunities for flexible work on their own terms without a formal con  nection to traditional organizations  in these types of groups  in  dividuals have the choice to opt in to or out of projects based on their own best interests   the third set of studies in this subdomain explores team formation systems  these studies use digital platforms to create teams  albeit in very different ways  there are a variety of specific technologies  for  l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly                 example huddler or mydreamteam  that allow teams to self organize online based on algorithms that recommend teammates to one another  with peer production teams it is the platform that lays out the work  and then teams form organically based on mutual attraction to the work itself  with flash teams  a leader uses a platform to design the work and then chooses a set of paid experts to carry out the work  the leader of the flash team is designing the team  in contrast to the way teams form with peer production or flash team platforms  with team formation systems members self organize  but it s not the attraction to the work that brings them together  it is the attraction to each other   as an example of this distinction  on wikipedia a peer production team came together to curate the page on  florentine painting  because of their shared expertise and interest in accurately conveying the most notable painters  paintings  techniques  and influences on florentine painting  the team formed because its members were all drawn to the same task  in contrast  those who join teams in team formation systems do so on the basis of personal bases of attraction  they choose who to work with  and the task follows  one example of a team formation system is the online tool huddler that  utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize for highly familiar teammates     another is a tool called my  dreamteam   which is an online searchable tool where those joining project teams can run queries to search for teammates matching those of their ideal teammates  all of these studies explore new leadership capabilities invited by technologies   if we adopt a technology as a team creation medium perspective  then we see the ways that technology is expanding the purview of team leadership  research from this perspective has taken as a starting point the introduction of a new technology  and then investigated the ways the technology creates leadership needs that take effect during the process of team formation  and then as the team develops and needs to reconfigure itself  as we review research on technology as a creation medium  we see how this genre of work invites leadership researchers to expand the functional lens to place greater emphasis on leadership during team formation  work in this area expands the focus of leader  ship  illustrating ways that leadership dynamics are set in motion during the team formation process aided by digital platforms  to il  lustrate this point  consider the leadership processes involved in online peer production teams   the leadership that occurs within peer production teams is self  governing  there is often a person or group of people who act as ad  ministrators ensuring that the technical infrastructure is set up and maintained    besides the one layer of leadership defined by the platform s organizational structure  the bulk of the leadership in peer production is emergent  many of the active contributors of peer production teams  who are the individuals who do the bulk of the content creation in a platform like wikipedia  are also often identified as taking on a leadership role and are often not compensated for their work    as peer production is a voluntary activity  team leaders must find non monetary ways to motivate others to contribute  this means leaders must provide intrinsic rewards for contributors such as creating a community that contributors can embed themselves within and derive meaning from    recruiting members to the team and erecting a meaningful boundary that serves as a basis for positive social categorizations is especially important in these groups that form outside of any formal organizational structure   from a leadership perspective  these teams are formed by those with project needs or vision  or workers can join a pre existing cause  started and maintained by individuals they may never meet in person  in these situations  many of the leadership processes are occurring before team members even join the team  leadership involves recruiting team members  monitoring progress  and determining when new members need to be added or existing members disenfranchised   research taking a technology as creation medium perspective has explored the ways in which traditional and emerging leadership  functions are carried out in online platforms  starting with the tradi  tional function of meeting team affective needs  a number of studies have explored how technologies can play a role in meeting the lea  dership needs of teams as they form  these studies do not study how team leaders use technology   or are affected by technology    but rather  investigate a new function of forming teams  and some studies reflect a technology per  forming the leadership function even without the awareness of the team  for example  salehi et al    show that their tool huddler enables teams with greater familiarity to form faster than they can without the tool and that familiarity doubles the performance of crowd worker teams  another example is work done by luther and bruckman   which observes that one of the functions of leaders in online creative collaboration is to design a collaborative project for the team to form around   in a set of studies wherein digital technology oversees a team dating process  team members work with the technology to form teams    team dating uses a technology to allow people to meet a variety of potential teammates quickly for short encounters  rating them  and then being matched with higher  rated teammates  another study demonstrates how technology can take on leadership functions using a personality matching algorithm    the technology used an algorithm to form teams with balanced personality types  crowd worker teams whose members have different personality types experi  enced less conflict and greater satisfaction than more homogenous teams  interestingly  when given a choice of being matched based on their own ratings or the average ratings of people provided by everyone participating  people prefer their own ratings    although not explicitly labeled team dating  other researchers have investigated the use of a community wide deliberation process prior to team formation  and researchers found that this process prior to team formation resulted in higher team performance after team formation     also on the topic of leading team affect  it is interesting to note that a set of platforms is cropping up to allow individuals who work in paid crowdsourcing environments and on peer production and flash teams to discuss their experiences and rate the  employers   four of them sup  porting the amazon mechanical turk workforce are  turkernation  mturk forum  mturkgrind  and mturk crowd  workers come here to decide which projects to participate in and which to avoid    although crowdsourcing research often takes a technology as sociomaterial view  the work on these kinds of groups pre formation falls within our technology as creation medium perspective  since this work examines the groups and technology before and as they are being created rather than after they are created  for individuals who regularly organize and lead flash teams  these forums provide an important source of reputational capital that affects their ability to lead projects by attracting top talent in the future   research taking a technology as creation medium view has also explored the ways in which technologies play a role in supporting team cognition as teams form  specifically  research on crowd teams has examined the role of technology in team cognition such as team fa  miliarity  mental scaffolding  and collective intelligence  overall  lea  dership functions have also been preliminarily found to affect team cognitive processes  for example  crowd teams high in interpersonal familiarity have been shown to outperform crowd teams low in inter  personal familiarity  which is believed to be because of team cognition    also  differences in expertise levels can impede crowd workers  collaborative effectiveness  specifically  a crowd worker team s use of modifiable shared artifacts to scaffold ideas between team members and crowd workers was shown to improve collaboration    research has found that peer production group members use other s history of project activity to form impressions of other s expertise    an expert leader in a  l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             crowd worker team can also be helpful in leading non experts to suc  cessfully accomplish data analysis tasks    finally  collective intelligence systems can help or  ganizations to create optimal teams from crowds to fit specific organi  zational needs    together  these results suggest preliminary evidence for the role of leader beha  viors influencing team cognitive processes in teams using technology as a creation medium  in crowd worker teams and peer production teams  leaders must be particularly careful about clarifying team boundaries so that team members can form productive cognitive models about one another   research taking a technology as creation medium view has also explored the ways in which technologies play a role in supporting team behavioral processes as teams form  in order to illustrate what we mean by this  consider a flash team  when a leader decides to create a flash team  and recruit team members to join  the leader designs a workflow in the platform  creating workflows in flash teams is the act of dividing up crowdsourcing jobs into smaller tasks  the workflow largely dictates who communicates with whom in the course of coordinating the work  once the leader determines the workflow  the technology largely gov  erns team behavioral processes  team interactions travel where the tracks were laid down by the flash team leader and then are continually reinforced by the technology  research finds these workflows provide a useful coordination artifact  but also prevent team members from being able to adapt personal work plans when needed     taken together  the work on leadership functions taking a creation medium view of technology suggests unique ways that technologies are shaping team formation within and outside formal organizations  these technologies shape who comes together in teams in the first place or at all  and also sets team dynamics in motion  the key assumption about leading teams from this technology perspective is that team leaders can leverage technologies during the team formation stage to foster the development and maintenance of needed team states and process  as such  we summarize the following leadership implication supported by our review of this work   leadership implication     team leaders can use team formation technologies in order to foster the development of functional affective and cognitive states and enactment of team processes   in reviewing these studies  we note a key shift in thinking about leadership that needs to be mentioned  most of these studies look at how team members can use technologies during team formation  the idea being that how individuals use technology during team formation can be pivotal in supporting teamwork later on  other studies look at how the technology can be programmed in such a way as to take the team members out of the leadership loop during team formation  these studies move toward using the technology in team formation as an al  ternative or substitute for leadership  as a case in point  huddler   and related studies   in the genre seek to codify into an algorithm the choices and actions of team leadership during the team formation process  based on this  we summarize the following additional leadership implication that arises from the tech  nology as creation medium perspective   leadership implication     digital technologies used during team formation can serve a team leadership role by fostering the development of functional affective and cognitive states and enactment of team processes   not only does the creation medium perspective have implications for leadership of the most commonly studied teamwork states and processes  but research conducted with this view in mind suggest ad  ditional leadership functions as well  boundary work has long been an important aspect of team leadership and presents as particularly critical to leading wherein technology is a creation medium  a boundary de  fines who is on a team and who is not    examples of boundaries that may be drawn in organizations are vertical boundaries   horizontal boundaries  demographic boundaries  and geographic boundaries    vertical boundaries occur across levels of hierarchy whereas horizontal boundaries occur across function or expertise level  demographic boundaries occur across group diversities such as gender  age  or cultural background  and geographic boundaries occur between those located in different locations  bound  aries provide teams with needed entitativity  a perception of group si  milarity and interconnectedness    hackman   suggests that  real teams  require boundaries that distinguish those on the team from those who are not  meaningful boundaries serve as a basis for positive social categorization processes  define ingroups and outgroups  and inspire  motivate  and promote collaboration within boundaries     technological advances raise the importance of boundary manage  ment work in technologically enabled environments  but also the challenges of dynamic boundary management work in such contexts    team boundary spanning  or team boundary management  is  a team s efforts to establish and manage external linkages  that can occur within and between teams and organizations    we adapt the classic definition of team boundary management for a technologically enabled definition that better suits the boundary complexities that leaders face within teams that use technology as a creation medium  like flash teams or peer production groups  in these teams that form entirely through online platforms  leader boundary management will be critical to gaining participation  creating functional norms  and sustaining member motivation to contribute to the team   research taking a technology as creation medium view has un  covered a new leadership function needed by teams in informal online environments  with flash teams  the team leaders need to continuously reevaluate who stays on the team  the fluidity of flash teams requires teams to balance conflict with cohesion  constantly defining and re  defining the boundary of the collective project in order to socialize newcomers and extradite members who no longer advance the shared vision     team boundaries  or a lack of clear team boundaries  is especially salient in teams in which technology is being utilized as a creation medium  to give some context  the bulk of work contributed in peer production communities  such as a wikipedia page  is typically com  pleted by a small group of contributors who claim leadership in creating that particular page    however  unlike in a typical organization  there are no organizational or hierarchical struc  tures in place to guide contributors in who leads whom  technically  in an open source  peer production project  anyone can contribute to the project  how does the core of contributors regulate the creation and quality of output on the page  the core group of contributors must navigate the fluid boundaries of the peer production project through whatever means of communication and coordination are available to them in the platform  these forms of organizing are also increasingly being used inside formal organizations in open innovation projects    although team boundary spanning is a well known leadership behavior  what do leaders do when there is a clear lack of boundaries to span  setting up and managing team boundaries through effective leader boundary management is critical to the overall performance and viability of those working in the peer production group  fluid boundaries are a particular challenge for lea  ders of teams using technology as a creation medium  based on this work emphasizing the increasing challenges related to boundary man  agement  we suggest the following leadership implication   leadership implication     team leaders can use team formation technologies to manage team boundaries both during team formation  determining who s on the team  and also during subsequent team phases through the periodic reevaluation of team membership   l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             not only are digital technologies playing a role in team leadership functions  they are also shaping the form leadership takes on in the team  distributed leadership is where multiple team members take part in leading the team    and was examined in flash teams using a tool called pipeline    pipeline was designed to  support and transform leadership  with the goal of easing the burden on leaders of online creative pro  jects     the pipeline tool  redistributes  leadership to spread the burden of leadership across multiple team members  which was theorized to improve team effectiveness  another study on leadership forms in wikipedia finds strong evidence for the presence of shared leadership among the online encyclopedia groups    studies like these show how a digital technology can shape the leadership form that comes about  other studies show how individuals  behavior with these technologies can shape their own fate as team leaders   as a case in point  studies using the mydreamteam   tool found significant disparities in the number of team invitations individuals sent out  this disparity was important because the study also found that being central in the team invitation network  i e   being the one who invites everyone to the team  predicted leader emergence once the team began to work together    hence  those who are most active in using technologies to assemble teams may also have an outsized role in leading them once formed   reflecting the technology as team creation medium lens  these studies find consequential leadership dynamics are playing out in on  line digital platforms as teams are forming and are shaping the lea  dership functions and forms involved in teamwork later on  the studies of tools like pipeline highlight the ways digital tools are shaping lea  dership structures in teams  studies like twyman   show actions taken during team formation can shape team leadership emergence later on as the team executes taskwork  accordingly  we note the fol  lowing leadership implications that relate to team leadership forms   leadership implication     digital technologies can shape the leadership structures that emerge in teams   leadership implication     team members actions and interactions during team formation within digital technologies can play a role in who emerges as a team leader   technology as a teammate  the fourth area of research takes yet another perspective of tech  nology  work adopting a technology as teammate perspective explores the ways that digital technologies are advancing to the point of ful  filling a distinct role on the team    as the long history of work on digital technologies and teams clearly suggests  technologies have long been important to teams  the role of technology in the other three perspectives has been to understand how technology affects teamwork  in the context view  it constrains teamwork  in the sociomaterial view  it gives rise to work practices  in the creation medium view  it creates new opportunities to lead during the formation process  in the team  mate view  technology is not viewed as it constrains or augments what team members are doing  technology is viewed as a motivated social being operating as a co equal member of the team   we are quickly approaching a time when digital technologies are as agentic as are human counterparts  historically  humans have worked alongside machines in many forms  such as in automobile assembly lines or cracking codes in world war    today  many airplanes have an autopiloting system consisting of code that works as a teammate alongside human pilots  the future promises even more automation in our day to day lives with innovations in autonomous transportation  like self driving ubers and autonomous ground transportation  moreover  autonomous agents will become more embedded in organi  zational life  as organizations begin to use ai in nearly every corner of  their organizations  from human resources    selection   and training    to steering and investment decisions     the extant literature on leadership in teams has focused on lea  dership of teams of humans  however  as we just listed in the previous paragraph  technology is becoming increasingly prevalent within our teams  taking on team roles and functions that used to be occupied by humans    important work in the human computer interaction literature has started to push the boundaries of this work to not only think about the best possible design of technologies for human use  but also con  sideration of how to create technologies that can best take on team roles or functions so that they can also collaborate well with their human teammates    in contrast to our previous per  spectives wherein technology was being used by humans or augmenting human behavior  our review of the literature invites us to acknowledge a new perspective on leadership and technology  technology as a teammate   although clearly relevant to organizational scholars  work ex  amining technology as a teammate has primarily lived in areas other than organizational behavior  kellogg  valentine  and christin   proclaim  organizational scholarship has not kept pace with the ways that algorithmic technologies have the potential to transform organi  zational control in profound ways  with significant implications for workers     thus  we find much of the work on technology as teammate originating from the area of human computer interaction and other technology related areas  rather than in the organization sciences  human robot teams have been the subject of study in these areas for much of the  th century in the form of assembly line teams  for ex  ample  although the study of the interaction between humans and ro  bots is not new  only within the past decade or so has the scholarly research been able to actually study human interaction with intelligent agents  this is due to the fact that the intelligent technologies have only recently become  intelligent   with the creation of artificially in  telligent agents such as ibm s watson  thus  the human ai team has only come about in the  st century   at this point  it is useful to distinguish the terms agent  technology  robot  and ai  decostanza et al    distinguish a technology from an agent when it comes to teams   we reserve the term technology for those devices  software  protocols  and other interventions that target the members of the team with the goal of improving team processes  it is entirely possible that a technology will also be a team member  which we refer to as an agent  we use the term technology when referring to its role as assisting in team performance as opposed to satisfying its role in the team     a robot can be either a technology or an agent  depending on its role in the team  if the robot merely augments a human  making no unique contributions to the team apart from making a human more effective  then it is a technology  if  on the other hand  the robot is a team member fulfilling a distinct role in the team and making a unique contribution to performance  then it is an agent  for the purposes of our review  we use the term robot to refer to the latter meaning  where robots are a type of agent  serving as a member of the team  thus  the perspective of technology as teammate deals with technology that acts as an agent  not just a technology   next  it is necessary to distinguish the difference between robots and ai to better define human robot teams from human ai teams  robots are embodied agents with physical features roughly resembling human characteristics  not all agents are embodied  and disembodied compu  tational systems can also be a teammate  which introduces the notion of artificial intelligence   to teams  ai is defined as the use of a com  puter to  perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence  such as visual perception  speech recognition  decision making  and translation between languages     the most critical aspect of this definition being  tasks normally requiring human in  telligence   since this distinguishes ai from automation which also  l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             involves technology performing human tasks  but typically more be  havioral tasks  we use the term agent in human agent teams to refer to cases where a technology serves as a team member broadly  this um  brella term then captures two types of human agent teams  human  robot teams and human ai teams  the primary distinction between the two being the physical embodiment of the robot  both are computer  ized  employ computational algorithms  and occupy a role on the team  however  the robot is physically embodied while the ai teammate is not  the distinction is useful because prior work on robot embodiment is important for leading human robot teams  but not for leading human  ai teams   human robot teams are composed of humans and embodied in  telligent agents working interdependently in pursuit of a common goal    human robot teams include teams of humans and robots working on assembly lines together and teams of human cooks and touch screens working as order takers in a fast food restau  rant  human ai teams are composed of humans and disembodied in  telligent agents working interdependently in pursuit of a common goal    examples of ai include machine learning or deep learning computational techniques used in the corporate world to predict market changes or human be  havior    machine learning algorithms  detect patterns and learn how to make predictions and recommendations by processing data and experiences  rather than by receiving explicit programming instruction     one could imagine ai being used in teams to run risk  analyses for team decisions or help with retaining and sharing relevant team information     extant research on humans working in teams with agents is still in its infancy  but one major point stressed in the extant literature on the topic is that human agent teaming of the future will present a range of challenges    humans have been working alongside some form of automation for decades  and there have obviously been leaders of such teams  how  ever  in the past  a leader s consideration of such technologies was to ensure that there was a person on the team that was equipped to manage or operate the technology and to step in if something mal  functioned  however  we are now moving into a new era of robotics and automation where agents are taking on more advanced executive functions  like choosing the team  providing feedback on team pro  cesses  or intervening to stimulate controversy over team decisions   though more nascent than the other three perspectives  this per  spective represents one of the most exciting new frontiers for team leadership research  though there are far fewer studies  particularly empirical ones to summarize in this domain  we synthesize existing conceptual perspectives with the lens applied thus far in our review in order to outline three leadership implications suggested by this early thinking on technology as teammate   a first set of thinking in this area relates to affective and cognitive leadership needs  a major issue in human agent teamwork is getting humans and technology to have productive affective processes  researchers have begun to investigate issues like trust in human robot interaction    in particular  research has found that humans  trust in robots was highly dependent on the robot s performance and perceived competence    another study found that team members preferred to cede control to a robot rather than a human teammate    teams have also been shown to perform better when they were emotionally attached to a robot teammate    researchers have even looked into anxiety detecting systems in human robot collaboration    however  little empirical research has been done on a leader s considerations in leading teams with modern day robotics working alongside human teammates   this research suggests that leaders must not only manage the in  teraction between humans and robots  but they must also consider the way introducing robots to teams might change human human re  lationships    introducing robots to social settings has been found to shape the interactions that occur among humans  for example  in a study introducing a snack delivery robot to the workplace  employees were later found to be more polite because they were paying close attention to how one another was treating the robot    another ex  ample is research examining the ability of a robot teammate to mend team conflicts  researchers had the robot interject with statements like   dude  what the heck  let stay positive     the study found that robots using conflict repairing strategies were able to in  fluence human human conflict interactions     research also highlights the leadership need related to team cog  nition  one obstacle acknowledged in expert reports is that a leader s job is to help team members better understand the technology    experts claim that human robot teaming of the future will be primarily more of a cognitively intensive challenge rather than a physical challenge because of the implicit expectations that humans have of their teammates  whether they are human or otherwise    related to cognitive team processes  a leader s job is two fold  first  leaders are and will continue to be pivotal in the de  velopment of productive teaming with intelligent agents  an extensive knowledge of teamwork and human interaction is crucial for designing technologies that work well with human team members  on the other hand  leaders must be able to help human team members adopt new technology teammates  including understanding the role of the tech  nology and how the technology is preprogrammed to perform that role on the team   taken together  early work on leadership functions taking a technology as teammate view emphasizes the need for leadership to develop functional affective and cognitive states  interestingly  these states have two foci  the interface between humans and machines  and the interface among human teammates who are working in the pre  sence of machines  the key assumption about leading teams from this technology perspective is that the addition of intelligent machines as full fledged team members with their own programmed and evolving motivations creates a leadership need of facilitating productive re  lationships among human and synthetic team members  the findings reviewed in this section can be summarized with the following lea  dership implication   leadership implication     team leaders need to foster functional affective and cognitive states and behavioral processes among human and synthetic team members so that human agent teams can perform effectively   adding intelligent machines as teammates creates additional lea  dership needs  ai is quickly becoming a source of competitive ad  vantage across industries and levels of organizations  and many in  dustrious organizational leaders are driving this trend  however  there are limits to the technology  the c suites of major technology firms   amazon  google  apple  and netflix  to name a few   routinely leverage ai  often in the form of machine learning  to help with pattern re  cognition and analysis to make organizational steering decisions    rather than human created rules that are pre pro  grammed into the algorithm  machine learning generates algorithms from data  these approaches first train on massive data sets  creating rules from patterns in the data set and are then refined through an iterative process of applying the rules to data  learning  adjusting rules  and so forth  organizations are beginning to rely on such algorithms in order to steer decision making processes  but there are limits  one major theme of concerns for leaders in using ai is the ethics behind the technology  some ethical considerations come from the data that is used to train the algorithms  the data used in training and making  l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             predictions might come from a data set that is biased  misinforming the team  until ethical standards are developed at an industry level  leaders must decide how to navigate the ethical questions of ai   leaders must navigate their human team members  acceptance of the technology used as teammate  the leader must learn about and stay up to date on the constant innovations occurring in the technology as well as clearly communicate the technology and its capabilities to the humans on the team in order to build team efficacy and trust around the technology  furthermore  the leader must communicate the necessary pieces of information about the technology acting as teammate so that humans understand the strengths and limitations of the technology  artificially intelligent machines tend to not advertise their limitations  so is an important responsibility for team leaders  one example where this mutual understanding of the technology s limitations is critical can be seen in the boeing   max crashes in early      pilots in these incidents were unaware of the lim  itations of a new update in the navigation systems  so the pilots did not know to take control from the navigation system at the appropriate time  although an extreme example  the boeing   max incidents underscore the importance of having everyone on the same page  both humans and technologies  a leader s intricate knowledge of all team  mates  human and otherwise  is critical in teams wherein technology is perceived as a teammate   leadership implication     team leaders need to ensure that team members have a shared understanding of the limits of technology and when control needs to be taken back by human team members   not only does the prospect of synthetic teammates shape needed  team leadership functions  it also has important implications for lea  dership forms  several studies find humans appreciate ceding some leadership responsibility over to robots  in a study by gombolay and colleagues mentioned earlier  human team members preferred to cede control to the robot as compared to a human teammate  this has im  plications for shared leadership more generally  if humans prefer sharing leadership with technologies  this may make it more difficult for humans to share leadership with one another  also speaking to this issue is work by lee et al    on a study of the snackbot robot that brought snacks to offices over a period of   months  this employee s quote is telling about how bonds between humans and robots can later spill into human relationships   one time i told snackbot i think snackbot asked me if there was maybe a tour of  building  or some  thing  which room should snackbot take me up to  and i just told snackbot that probably someone would program it  it s a robot  it s probably not going to make those choices  and then my office mate was like   oh  now you ve gone and made snackbot feel bad   so i think part of it is about how my relationship with snackbot is not just about snackbot but about other people who are around and kind of see us     when human relationships are shaped in part by how humans relate to technology  we would expect these interac  tions to shape leadership emergence in teams  those whose interactions are more positive toward and effective in interacting with technological teammates   are themselves likely to be seen as more capable leaders  this leads to our final leadership implication   leadership implication     team members  interactions with synthetic teammates can play a role in shaping who emerges as a leader  and the overall leadership structure that emerges in human agent teams   discussion  in reviewing the research on teams using digital technologies  we distinguished four perspectives on technology that were not labeled as such  but at closer inspection suggest the authors adopted somewhat differing assumptions about the role of technology in teamwork  then  as we summarized the findings from each view using the two dimen  sions of leadership  functions and forms  we identified a set of leader  ship implications that arise from each perspective  some of these im  plications are close to those found in other reviews  particularly those in the technology as context domain  but others offer exciting new di  rections for team leadership research  in this closing section  we high  light the novel implications suggested by our review and the future directions they imply for the research and practice of leading teams   new directions for leading teams in the digital age  in reviewing research on team leadership from a technology vantage point  we identified twelve leadership implications suggested from this work  as we look across the leadership implications arising from these perspectives  summarized in table    we would like to highlight three opportunities ripe for future leadership theory and research  these in  clude    leading technology practices    leading teams across an expanded set of functions  and   collaboratively leading teams along with technology   the first new direction suggested by our review is increased atten  tion to the various ways team leaders shape technology practices  a leadership function discussed above and brought about by new tech  nologies is that leaders must be aware that they help create team context and shape how teams utilize various types of technology  a process called team technology appropriation  this particular leadership function applies in particular to leaders in online communities crowds  peer production groups  and flash teams  for example  wikipedia  the peer produced online encyclopedia  was founded by jimmy wales  who was the first leader within the wikipedia platform  as such  jimmy wales created context and helped to shape team technology  table   summary of leadership implications stemming from four technology perspec  tives   technology as team context leadership implication     team leaders need to compensate for the challenges that  virtual teams face in developing functional affective and cognitive states and enacting team processes  challenges that are created by virtual collaboration     leadership implication     shared leadership forms are better than vertical forms for helping virtual teams develop functional affective and cognitive states and enact team processes   technology as sociomaterial team practices leadership implication     team leaders can shape technology practices in order to  foster the development of functional affective and cognitive states and enactment of team processes   leadership implication     team technology practices can shape the emergence of team leadership structures  and the stability versus fluidity of team leadership structures   technology as team creation medium leadership implication     team leaders can use team formation technologies in  order to foster the development of functional affective and cognitive states and enactment of team processes   leadership implication     digital technologies used during team formation can serve a team leadership role by fostering the development of functional affective and cognitive states and enactment of team processes   leadership implication     team leaders can use team formation technologies to manage team boundaries both during team formation  determining who s on the team  and also during subsequent team phases through the periodic reevaluation of team membership   leadership implication     digital technologies can shape the leadership structures that emerge in teams   leadership implication     team members  actions and interactions during team formation within digital technologies can play a role in who emerges as a team leader   technology as a teammate leadership implication     team leaders need to foster functional affective and  cognitive states and behavioral processes among human and synthetic team members so that human agent teams can perform effectively   leadership implication     team leaders need to ensure that team members have a shared understanding of the limits of technology and when control needs to be taken back by human team members   leadership implication     team members  interactions with synthetic teammates can play a role in shaping who emerges as a leader  and the overall leadership structure that emerges in human agent teams   l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             appropriation at the beginning of wikipedia s life  once wikipedia shifted to a more democratically run system  wikipedia page editors in good standing could run for positions in wikipedia administration    today  wikipedia is led by decisions made by those elected administrators  on a more micro level  there are page editors who take responsibility for certain pages or topic areas  both administrators and page editors alike now decide how to move forward with the context and technology appropriation  such as with the formation and use of comment sections within wikipedia through which editors may communicate   the second new direction suggested by our review is an expanded set of leadership functions  specifically  our review suggests that lea  dership actually begins before a team even forms  our review took us into the team formation literature and brought up a few implications of leadership responsibilities in team formation  another new function from the technology as teammate perspective is the need for team leaders to ensure that team members hold a shared understanding of when authority that has been shared with synthetic teammates needs to shift to human teammates  issues of control get to the heart of how humans and autonomous agents interact  control is the basic me  chanism by which human team members monitor ai at key points in time  with the ability to intervene if deemed necessary  in thinking about how leaders manage ai control  the concept of a team interaction mental model is useful    a team interaction mental model is a mental representation among team members about how members interact in performing taskwork  leading teams with syn  thetic teammates will require the development of effective human  agent interaction models  these mental representations will need to be shared by human teammates and programmed into the ai by tech  nology developers that ensure control mechanisms that are clear to all team members  human and synthetic   the third new direction suggested by our review is collaboratively leading teams along with technology  this direction came out of the technology as team creation medium perspective when we found stu  dies designing algorithms that would essentially take over the team leader s role in staffing  we also saw this suggested in the technology as teammate domain when robots were given control of task allocation processes   or programmed to diffuse inter  personal tension    discussions of how ai will affect managers often focus on two things     ai can reduce the amount of time leaders spend doing administrative work  and    ai will take on more and higher level decision making    as advances in ai render intelligent agents better able to take on much of the direct ad  ministration  scheduling  and coordinating work in teams  human lea  ders can be more effective to the extent that they develop ways to share this work with their synthetic teammates  similarly  as deep learning algorithms prove their value in making important decisions  leaders can work alongside these algorithms  adding their distinctive expertise on social and interpersonal issues that need to be considered in tandem with algorithmic judgement  the notion of ceding some responsibility for leadership of team formation to intelligent machines opens up a new research direction  what are the different forms of sharing leadership with intelligent machines  which aspects of leadership are team members more and less willing to share with synthetic teammates  and in terms of performance  which structures best promote effective teamwork in human agent teams   these three themes apparent from examining team leadership from a technology perspective suggest new and interesting directions for leading teams  new sets of leadership activities come about when we focus on sociomaterial practices or technology as a creation medium  new sets of functions come about when we probe the technology as creation medium or technology as teammate perspectives  lastly  from the technology as creation medium and technology as teammate vistas  we are invited to consider the ways leadership can be effectively shared between human and synthetic teammates  whereas the preceding  discussion highlights new directions for leading teams revealed by our review  it is also important to point out the enduring aspects of team leadership   enduring aspects of leading teams  across the four perspectives  functional aspects of team leadership are as important as ever for supporting teamwork across the many technology enabled teams explored in our review  leadership activities that promote the emergence of affective states in teams came up as important across areas  trust was a common need across studies viewing technology as a context    as a creation medium    and as a teammate    cognitive team needs also cut across technology viewpoints  studies viewing technology as context point out the need for leaders to address the lack of shared meaning across dis  tributed team members    studies viewing technology as sociomaterial call out team roles like the  shaper  who organizes diverse contributions into a coherent product    and studies in the technology as teammate genre emphasize that leaders need to enable human and synthetic team members to understand and predict others  thoughts     while the functional needs were present across studies conducted with different technologies in mind  another observation looking across these studies is the importance of contextualizing leadership functions to the technology  for example  team behavioral processes are needed by all teams  and yet the four technology views highlight interesting differences in the kinds of behaviors required to align team member contributions  for example  many studies of virtual teams focus gen  erally on the need for communication   whereas studies of teams on large online platforms take a far more nuanced view of the behaviors that align members  contribu  tions like engendering roles or evolving technology practices    even more detailed and contextualized in the technology are behaviors described in studies of human agent teams  consider this description of backchanneling behavior   a set of mostly nonverbal behaviors by a listener in a conversation  which signals to the speaker that the listener is actively engaged in the interaction  it includes be  haviors such as  mm hmm  vocalizations  slight nodding  eye contact  and orientation toward the speaker     these kinds of technology contextualized processes will continue to be es  sential in developing leadership theory and practice in the digital age   our review also highlights that leadership forms continue to be an important aspect of leadership  and one that is likely to be shaped by digital technologies  whereas leadership functions are a more tangible and observable aspect of teams  leadership forms are less visible to team members  conceptual and meta analytic works point to the importance of leadership structures in enabling team performance    a theme evident in the tech  nology as creation medium and technology as sociomaterial perspective is that technology can be pivotal in shaping team leadership structures     we can see from the preceding discussion that leadership functions and forms continue to be meaningful aspects of leading teams across technology perspectives  however  by examining the ways these two dimensions of team leadership are theorized across perspectives  we can better understand how these functions are met differently in different technology environments  having taken stock of three ways that tech  nology opens up new possibilities for leadership theory and research  and the continued utility of the dimensions of functions and forms of leadership  we conclude by considering some of the implications of technological advances for leadership development   l  larson and l a  dechurch the leadership quarterly             leadership development in the digital age  the four perspectives of technology in teams highlighted in this review point to new directions in leadership development  as organi  zations continue to structure work around teams  relying more on in  formal relationships and less on formal hierarchy  leadership develop  ment has evolved to emphasize the importance of relationship building  accordingly  the targets of leadership development efforts focus on the need to build social capital  rely on relational competence  and leverage social awareness and social skills    leading teams in the digital age suggests two directions for leadership development    extending the relational focus to include technologies and   exploring ways that emerging ai tools can augment leader relational compe  tencies   in the technology as context view  leadership development frame  works   em  phasize the role of context in more technologically enabled teams and the need for leaders to build important intra  and inter team relation  ships given this context    work in this domain guides research and theory in leadership development    the other three views of technology and teams invite us to consider additional directions for leadership development   in the technology as sociomaterial view  we might consider func  tional and structural leadership affordances  for example  affordances like association explain how material aspects of technology and human intentions jointly enable knowledge sharing in organizations    the association affordance describes the ways tech  nologies can signal  established connections between individuals  be  tween individuals and content  or between an actor and a presentation     similarly  leadership affordances can explain the ways in which materiality and motives constitutively shape leadership emergence and effectiveness in teams  as an illustration  we may consider a shared leadership affordance as the use of technological features to signal the distribution of leadership across team members  needed team roles  and over time  for example  when teams have access to a communication mapping tool    this may enable team leadership focused on equal participation in the team  leadership development efforts are increasingly expanding the toolkit to leverage network enhancing practices that focus on one of three aims  help in  dividuals build social competence  help individuals shape networks  or help collectives co create networks    the technology affordance perspective may offer a way forward to enable a greater emphasis on network based interven  tions that target the structure of groups  previous research calls for leadership development efforts that target teams   and use insights from shared leadership research   with prescriptive advice for designing team interactions  the notion of leadership affordances is ripe for future theory and research and re  presents a novel approach to leadership development   in the technology as team creation medium perspective  we might consider the role of relationship building activities carried out prior to and during team formation as an additional area for leadership devel  opment  research in this area suggests activities related to forming teams   and mon  itoring team production using technologies   are additional aspects of leadership   in the technology as teammate view  leadership development needs to expand focus to understand the leadership imperatives of building effective relationships among human and synthetic teammates  among human teammates as they interact with synthetic teammates  and among multiple synthetic teammates   the second implication for leadership development concerns ex  ploring how ai tools  such as cognitive assistants  can augment leader relational competencies  a cognitive assistant  helps its user with  various tasks     prevalent examples of cognitive assistants include amazon s alexa and google home   or ibm s watson for oncology which will  review all of the data and recommend treatment options based on the latest evidence and guidelines     cognitive assistants have the potential to augment current leadership development practices  such as   degree feedback  coaching  mentoring  or action learning    cognitive assistants can work one on one with organizational members to target individualized learning  development  and self reg  ulation  alternatively  cognitive assistants can work as teammates to help the team learn and develop together  the cognitive assistant may  see things  that team leaders might miss  like the structure of leader  ship  manifesting in subtle speech patterns otherwise undetectable to humans  intelligent cognitive assistants represent a fascinating future direction for leadership development   conclusion  instead of handing out a book at the next leadership development seminar  might attendees receive a shiny new device called google teamwork instead  could such a speaker  that observes work patterns and makes personalized recommendations  ultimately replace executive coaches  perhaps insights gleaned from listening in the workday background will be used to auto generate a highly customized podcast delivered during an executive s daily gym workout  rapid advances in technology and organizing invite a new genre of leadership scholarship  age old questions of who emerges as influential  how leadership tran  sitions and or comes to be shared  and the leadership processes best promoting effectiveness take on new meaning when we envision crowds and intelligent robots  or  cobots     working alongside humans in teams  as computer sci  entists push the technological frontier  leadership scholars must con  sider the implications of these

universiteit amsterdam  netherlands b cass business school  united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland  a r t i c l e i n f o  keywords  causal inference leadership instrumental variable design natural experiment regression discontinuity design topic modeling  a b s t r a c t  endogeneity is a serious challenge for leadership research  to overcome the problem  researchers increasingly rely upon experimental designs  such as laboratory and field experiments  in this paper  we argue that natural experiments   in the form of standard natural experiments  instrumental variable  and regression discontinuity designs   offer additional opportunities to infer causal relationships  we conduct a systematic  cross dis  ciplinary review of   studies that leverage natural experimental designs to inquire into a leadership topic  we introduce the standard natural experiment  instrumental variable  and regression discontinuity design and use topic modeling to analyze which leadership topics have been investigated using natural experimental designs  based on the review  we provide guidelines that we hope will assist scholars in discovering natural exogenous variations  selecting the most suitable form of natural experiment and by mobilizing appropriate statistical techniques and robustness checks  the paper is addressed to leadership and management scholars who aim to use natural experiments to infer causal relationships   introduction  the community of leadership scholars has started to take important steps to advance causal empirical research    along this line  podsakoff and podsakoff   refer to a methodological turn towards  experiments   docu  mented by the recent surge in the number of publications that adopt an experimental research design    expanding on this turn  podsakoff and podsakoff   also provide a comprehensive introduction and guidelines regarding three types of experimental design  laboratory experiments  field experi  ments  and quasi experiments   our review article aims to enrich the  experimental toolbox  avail  able to leadership scholars by emphasizing a fourth type of experiment  namely  natural experiments  the key feature of natural experiments is the presence of  naturally  occurring events   such as new regulations  and laws  natural disasters  or economic and political crises   which heterogeneously affect the units of a population     given that these events generate random or as if random variations in the en  vironment  natural experiments mimic the experimental ideal in which units   are split into a treatment and a control group  or  alternatively  receive different levels of treat  ment  this setting enables causal inference even when the substantive relationship at hand is difficult to investigate in a laboratory setting and or would require operating costly  impractical  or unethical field experiments  typical examples are the impact of political leaders on the economic growth of a country   or the queen bee phenomenon     although natural experiments are popular in economics   and the political sciences    they have received less attention from management scholars       natural experiments differ from other forms of experiments that involve observational data  such as quasi experiments and field experiments  specifically  in the context of quasi experiments  units self select into the treatment or control condition    on the contrary  in natural experiments  the assignment procedure is random or as if random    in other words  units in a natural experiment should not have    information about the treatment    incentives and capacity to self select into one of the experimental conditions  also  natural experiments differ from field experiments  wherein scholars have control over the experimental manipulation     the leadership quarterly        available online   december        Â©   published by elsevier inc   t                      the present study aims to create momentum around causal empirical research on leadership through a systematic  cross disciplinary review of   studies regarding the field of leadership   and which use nat  ural experiment designs  in so doing  we pursue three analytically distinct  yet interrelated goals  firstly  we aim to understand how prior natural experiments map onto the space of leadership topics in terms of the total of   research articles published in the leadership quarterly between january   and march    secondly  we introduce the different types of natural experimental designs   i e   the standard natural experiment  the instrumental variable design  and the regres  sion discontinuity design   using concrete examples  thirdly  we pro  vide guidelines to assist leadership scholars in  discovering  relevant sources of natural experiments  identifying the most appropriate form of natural experiment to operate  and  finally  in analyzing the data that come from the diverse forms   methods  retrieving natural experiment studies in the field of leadership  this systematic review focuses on   studies that leverage a natural experiment design to inquire into phenomena or theoretical relation  ships regarding the field of leadership    we identified candidate studies via an electronic search conducted within scopus  we searched for business and management  psychology  social sciences  or multidisciplinary journal articles with the keywords  natural experiment    regression discontinuity design   or  instrumental variable  in the title  abstract  or set of author s generated keywords   for january   march     the timespan of our review   the search resulted in   unique items    the two authors independently went through each abstract and retained all the empirical studies that fulfilled two criteria  first  the work adopted at least one of the three forms of natural experiment  namely   standard natural experiments    instrumental variables   and  regression discontinuity designs     second  the work addressed at least one leadership topic theory included in gardner et al  s review of the theoretical conversations that characterize the leadership quarterly journal   having completed the independent screening phase  we validated the coding decisions  we thus considered the full papers of the   studies that were temporarily filtered in  any disagreement about the theoretical focus of each individual study was reconciled through discussion and by evaluating the focal study against the conceptual categories and examples presented in gardner et al    review  this led to the exclusion of five studies  finally  the results achieved via the scopus database were complemented with a google scholar search combining the above mentioned keywords with the term  leadership   this led to the inclusion of five additional studies  hence  our review was based on a set of   published articles    fig    illustrates the distribution of the studies with respect to the form of natural experiment   and the time period   involved  standard natural experiments   and instrumental variable designs   are the most popular forms of natural ex  periments in leadership research  and  overall  their diffusion seems to grow over time  regression discontinuity designs are the least popular form   and their use in the field of leadership is scattered over the last ten years  appendix a provides further descriptive elements regarding the set of studies   characterizing the natural experiment studies  as stated in the introduction  one of this paper s goals is to under  stand  how  natural experiment methods intersect with substantive to  pics in the field of leadership  in order to do this  we used topic mod  eling   a text mining tool rooted in computational linguistics and natural language processing   to assess how the studies retained map onto the topics dealt with in the leadership quarterly  in our case  a topic modeling approach has some advantages over manually coding papers  first  it lets the  data speak  as the study to topic pairing is re  vealed inductively by analyzing the corpus of texts  hence  the re  searcher does not need to subjectively assign a study to an established  theoretically derived topic  second  topic modeling offers a nuanced characterization of the substantive focus of a study  not only is the assignment of a document to a topic probabilistic  a document is also related to multiple topics  in other words  an article that investigates the firm level implications of gender diversity in top management teams may reflect both the  strategic leadership  and  gender diversity in groups  categories that gardner and colleagues map   in terms of design  our topic modeling involves two phases  in the first phase  we trained a latent dirichlet allocation   model   on the abstracts of the   research articles   published in the the leadership quarterly between january   and march    table   illustrates key estimates obtained using mallet   and the gensim   and spacy   libraries for python  each cell in the table indicates the probability of a term w   of occurring in a topic Ï    the analysis of the term topic pairs included in the model reveals a series of substantive categories that seem consistent with gardner et al  s review  the models emphasize topics such as  fe  male leadership      emotions and leadership      transformational leadership     development of leadership      dyadic relations      cognition and leadership      strategic leadership      ethical leadership      charismatic leadership     and  leadership in team and decision groups      in the second phase  we used a folding in strategy by  projecting  each of the   natural experiments onto the trained lda model  we thus represented each retained study in terms of the very same ten topics that represent the corpus of   abstracts published in the leadership quarterly between january   and march    this en  abled us to characterize a natural experiment in terms of one or a few salient topics   or to allocate it as being leadership research  appendix b provides further descriptive elements about the estimation procedure behind our lda model  the supplemental materials contain the data and the python code to reproduce the set of exhibits reported in the paper     we borrow this categorization from dunning s   book    the query we operated was as follows  title abs key   or title abs key   or title abs  key   and     the out  come of the query   in the form article level metadata   is available in the supplemental materials     data were retrieved on april       scientific publications may be af  filiated with multiple subject areas  for example  an article published in the leadership quarterly is associated with the  business  management and accounting    psychology   and  social sciences  categories  hence  conducting a separate  subject by subject search results in a higher number of publications than a search that concatenates the multiple subjects together     the supplemental materials report the categories associated with each in  dividual study

experiments  the standard natural experimental design was already used in the first ever natural experiment  in which snow   analyzed the transmission of cholera in london  in its  simplest  form  the standard natural experiment resembles the design of a randomized experiment in that there are two groups   the treatment and control group   with two observations per group   a pre  and a post treatment observation   as shown in fig     we can estimate the causal effect of the treatment by  comparing the average change of the outcome variable y for the treated units   and controls    of course  the  simple  form of the standard natural experiment can be extended in several ways  such as by adding additional treatment groups or by adding additional time periods before and or after the treatment     whether the standard natural experiment provides a causal estimate mainly depends on the qualities of the treatment  in the case of random variations  such as lotteries  the assignment process needs to be truly random    in the case of as if random variations  the assignment process needs to be independent of factors that are related to the outcome and not affected by the unit s self selection into treat  ment or control conditions    the second part of the document deals with these aspects in more detail   standard natural experiment and leadership research table   reports

short reference for the study  the re  maining columns provide a substantive characterization of the study  the right hand columns present the inductive categorization of studies as emerging from the topic modeling described in the previous section  in the interest of clarity  we have just reported the two most salient topics of each study   i e   the topics with the highest chance of being paired with the focal document   our topic model highlights the focus of the standard natural ex  periments and consists of three core topics    female leadership      strategic leadership     and  ethical leadership      together with a series of other themes that  although less central  still receive significant attention    the prominence of topics      and   is clear from fig     panel a  which shows the frequency with which salient topics appear in the documents   the scatter plot in panel b of fig    expands on the outcome of the topic model by positioning each natural experiment in the topic space that characterizes the population of articles published in the leadership quarterly  the coordinates of each data point are produced via multi  dimensional scaling  this allows us to create a shallow representation of the   dimension space underlying the topic model   stars  are asso  ciated with natural experiments  the leadership quarterly articles are represented with circles that have been color coded to reflect the dominant topic of the document  the diagram highlights that    standard natural experiments map onto a narrow portion of the space  whereas vast areas of leadership research have been barely or not im  pacted at all by this form of causal research    an initial cluster of studies emerges at the intersection of  female leadership  and strategic leadership      a second cluster of studies jointly investigate  ethical leadership  and  nature of managerial work  subjects     standard natural experiment examples our review shows there is a significant number of studies using  standard natural experiments to address selected leadership related topics  we concentrate on three examples in order to provide leadership scholars with insights into the application of the standard natural ex  periment for inferring causal relationships   the first study  by beaman et al     uses a standard natural experiment to analyze whether female leadership has an impact on girls  career aspirations and educational attainment  the authors hy  pothesize that a female leader will act as a role model for girls and young women  and will thereby affect their career aspirations and educational attainment  the authors argue that analyzing this re  lationship in laboratory experiments is difficult  because participants are exposed to the role model for a short period of time  whereas in observational studies  people may self select to certain role models based on observed and unobserved characteristics  beaman et al    thus exploit the enactment of a law in india in   that determined that in some randomly selected villages  the position of chief councilor was reserved for women  the law resulted into two treatment groups and a control group  the first treatment group consists of villages in which this position was reserved for women in one election    in the second treatment group  the position was re  served for women in two elections    and in the control group  the position was never reserved for women  the authors collected survey data from   randomly selected households in each village in   and    their difference in means analyses show that the gender gap in parents  career aspirations for their children was much lower in villages in which the council positions had been reserved for women twice compared to villages in which the position had been reserved for women once or never  the analyses also indicate that the gap in educational aspirations between boys and girls was much lower in villages with female leaders than in villages with male leaders  based on some additional analyses  the authors conclude that the effects are mainly caused by a role model effect  that is  female leaders provide a role model both for parents and for girls  overall  the standard natural experiment by beaman et al    provides important insights into the causal effect of female leadership on   followers  aspirations   in the second study  matsa and miller   exploit the introduc  tion of  gender quota  policies in norway to investigate how female leadership influences strategic choices and outcomes  for example corporate downscaling  the gender quotas forced all publicly listed firms in norway to increase the proportion of women on the board of directors to    within two years  because the gender quota policy applied to all listed firms  it was not a random variation in the reg  ulatory environment  however  the authors argue that the policy tar  gets companies that are part of a broader population of scandinavian firms  that is  organizations facing relatively similar cultural and in  stitutional factors  the norwegian policy may therefore have an as if  random interpretation  matsa and miller   used a matching ap  proach in which they first pair treated   and un  treated   norwegian firms  and  in the second step  linked norwegian firms to listed and unlisted firms located in denmark  fin  land  and sweden  the summary statistics showed that the treatment and control group were similar in terms of most firm characteristics  to analyze the causal effect of female leadership on strategic choices and outcomes  the authors used the difference in differences and difference  in difference in differences  analytical frameworks  they found that the gender quota had a negative impact on firm profitability  in further analyses  the authors showed that profit differentials were mainly at  tributable to the fact that companies treated with the quota policy tended to cut less jobs than their counterparts  to back up the causal interpretation of their results  matsa and miller   conducted several robustness checks  such as testing for trends before the in  troduction of the quota and testing whether the effects were stronger for firms with fewer women on their board of directors  overall  the study provides causal empirical evidence supporting the effect of fe  male leadership on firm performance as mediated by key strategic choices   fig     visual representation of the standard natural experiment  notes  the underlying population regression function is y  Î³t  Î»d  Î´td  where Î³  Î»  and Î´ represent the systematic difference in the outcome across the treated and control cases  the trend effect and the difference in the outcome that is due to the treatment

analyzes the relationship between leader tenure and countries  creditworthiness  the authors argue that higher leader tenure will reduce uncertainty in the sovereign credit market and will therefore increase a country s creditworthiness  since leader tenure is endogenous    the authors backup their panel data analysis with a natural experiment in which leader tenure is exogenously determined  they focused on countries characterized by attempts to assassinate the political leader  while such events are not random  as confirmed by the authors  balance tests    the outcome is as if random  the authors provide anecdotal evidence for this claim   and ex  cluded all assassinations in which the success was not determined by chance    shea and solis   used a two step approach in their analysis  first  they regressed sovereign bond yields on leader tenure  assassination success  and an interaction term  the interaction term was positive and significant  which indicated that as  sassination success had a stronger effect on bond yields at higher levels of leader tenure  second  the authors accounted for a potential selection in the assassination sample   by applying the heckman selection model  which supported the findings from the ols  overall  the study used an unusual exogenous variation of leader tenure to provide robust evidence that leader tenure influences a country s creditworthiness   to sum up  the three examples of standard natural experiments explore important leadership topics   and provide robust causal inference  the three studies use very different exogenous variations  such as laws or even assassination attempts  and focus on leadership in the contexts of villages  firms  and states  thus  the three examples highlight both the potential and the variability of standard natural experiments for lea  dership research   instrumental variable designs  instrumental variable   designs have already received some at  tention in management research  as several researchers recommend their use to correct for endogeneity in the relationship between an in  dependent variable and a dependent variable    the basic idea of the iv design is shown in fig     the treatment variable d is influenced by covariates a  b  and f  because at least one of the covariates is unobserved  we cannot  directly estimate the causal effect of the treatment d on the outcome y  the iv design  solves  the endogeneity problem  which results from the omitted variable bias  by leveraging an instrument c to which subjects are   randomly assigned     a valid instrument needs to fulfill three conditions    first  it needs to be exogenous  which means that it is uncorrelated with other causes of the dependent variable except for the treatment  second  the instrument needs to influence the assignment of the treatment    third  the instrument has no relationship with the dependent variable except through the treatment  a violation of the conditions can lead to a severe bias in the estimates    it is therefore important that researchers thor  oughly scrutinize any candidate instrument and check whether and to what extent it fulfills these three conditions   instrumental variable designs and leadership research table   reports the set of studies that draw upon the iv design  our  topic model   whose insights are summarized in fig     panel a   re  veals that  female leadership    and  strategic leadership    tend to dominate the focus of attention of this group of studies  in fact  the core topics are even more core in this case than in standard natural experiments  whereas the number of documents that build on the remaining topics is relatively small  panel b  showing the posi  tioning of iv designs in terms of the articles published in the leadership quarterly  confirms that the data points are concentrated in the bottom right of the chart   instrumental variable design examples our review shows that several studies in leadership research have  applied the iv design  but only to address very few topics  in this sec  tion  we will focus on three example studies and explain their approach in more detail in order to provide leadership scholars with insights into how the iv design can be applied   the first study was conducted by bennedsen et al     it ana  lyzed the relationship between ceo succession decisions  particularly the decision of family firms to hire a family or an external ceo  and firm performance  testing the causal effect of ceo succession decisions on firm performance is difficult  because family members have in depth knowledge regarding the characteristics of other family members    which will probably affect their decision to hire an external candidate  to infer a causal relationship  the authors use the gender of the departing family ceo s firstborn child as an instrument  they provide evidence that   the instrument is exogenous  because gender is randomly assigned    the instrument is relevant  because in the case of a family transition  it is about    higher when the firstborn child is male  and   the instrument is unlikely to affect firm perfor  mance through other channels than ceo succession decisions  because a first child s gender is not related to firm level attributes    the authors conducted supplemental statistical analyses   to back up their finding that appointing a family ceo leads to a decline of ca     in firm profitability  overall  the study adopts a creative instrument to estimate the causal impact of hiring professional managers on firm  level outcomes   in the second study  yang et al    investigated the relationships between students  centrality within a social network  gender  and at  tainment of leadership positions  the authors apply a two study design in which they first test their hypotheses based on observational data  then infer the causal relationship by means of an iv design  the cor  relational study shows that a student s ego network is related to her or his job placement in leadership positions  network centrality is posi  tively related to job placement both for male and female students   however  female students especially benefit from more women domi  nated networks and from relatively even communication with peers   fig     visual representation of the instrumental variable framework  notes  continuous  oriented arrows denote the causal effect linking two variables  dashed edges denote the presence of a common cause between two variables  c is an instrumental variable for d  a  b  and f

provides no insights into the causal focal relationship  the authors exploit an exogenous variation in the context  when students start their mba programme  they are randomly assigned to home sections  students take their first quarter classes only with students from their home section  which is why their home sec  tion mates initially represent their most important friends  later in their studies  students bid for second quarter classes  since the enroll  ment of students into classes is relatively unpredictable    students have limited influence on the inter personal ties they will develop  the au  thors used a student s degree of exposure to same gender classmates from other home sections as the instrument  the findings of the iv design mostly support the correlational study  female students  job placements are influenced by having an inner circle  whereas no effect was found for male students  overall  the study exploits the as if random assignment of students to networks as an instrument to esti  mate the causal effect of networks on attaining leadership positions  particularly for female leaders   finally  chintrakarn et al    investigated the relationship be  tween managers  religious piety and firms  anti takeover provisions  for the instrument  the authors used the degree of religious piety from   in the community surrounding a company s headquarters  first  the authors regressed the number of anti takeover defenses on the non in  strumented current religious piety variable and found a positive effect  in the second step  they analyzed the same relationship based on in  strumented values of current religious piety  the two stage least squares analysis supported the conclusion of the correlational analysis that current religious piety affects corporate governance  although the coefficient of the instrumented treatment variable was smaller   than the coefficient of the non instrumented treatment variable    as a robustness check  the authors used another instrumental variable   the degree of religious piety in the population in    the result of the two stage least squares supported the prior findings  overall  the authors provide evidence that religious piety substitutes for corporate governance and reduces the conflict between managers and shareholders   to sum up  the three examples highlight creative ways of applying instruments to estimate causal relationships involving a variety of lea  dership topics   including the consequences of leader selection for firms    leadership development    and the consequences of culture on strategic leadership     regression discontinuity design  the regression discontinuity  design was initially developed by thistlethwaite and campbell    it capitalizes on the fact that in many settings   a unit s score   above or below a certain threshold on a continuous variable   determines the treatment status of the unit  the basic idea of the rd design is shown in fig     when the assignment variable x is greater than or equal to x   which represents the threshold  units receive the treatment  if x is smaller than x   units receive no treatment  the rd design builds on the assumption that in the neighborhood of the threshold   the assign  ment process is almost random    then  the variance in the outcome variable y across the x  x  and x â¥ x  regimes is caused by the treatment    re  presented by the quantity Î´   so far  we have assumed that the probability of treatment assign  ment changes from   to   when x  x   this so called  sharp  rd design is probably the most common form in empirical research  however  some studies also apply a  fuzzy  rd design  here  the change in the probability of receiving the treatment is much smaller than in the sharp rd design when x â¥ x     for instance  the probability of receiving the treatment may just increase by several percentage points at the threshold    although the sharp and the fuzzy rd differ to some extent  re  searchers can use both rd designs to estimate the average causal effect of the treatment   regression discontinuity designs and leadership research table   shows the set of leadership studies drawing upon an rd  design  the distribution of leadership topics across the documents   confirms causal methods   irrespective the specific estimation framework   are core to the study of female leadership    in addition  the rd design seems to associate to another two topics  namely  nature of managerial work    and  leadership in teams and decision groups      regression discontinuity design examples our review indicates that to date only a few leadership studies have  used the rd design  we will discuss three studies and analyze their approach in more detail in order to provide leadership scholars with insights into applying the rd design for inferring causal relationships   the first study that we have selected is by arvate et al     they adopted a sharp rd design to analyze the  queen bee  phenomenon    which states that women in lea  dership positions do not support   and may even penalize   female followers  the authors point out that prior studies on the phenomenon are affected by reverse causality and omitted variable biases  and  therefore  do not have a causal interpretation  to overcome these problems  the authors use an rd design focusing on close run elections in brazilian municipalities  empirical data indicate that those munici  palities in which women are elected as mayors over a male candidate by a close margin do not differ from municipalities in which women just lost the election against a male competitor  thus  near the threshold    it is almost random as to whether a woman or a man is assigned to the leadership position  the results do not provide clear evidence for the queen bee hypothesis  in public organizations  which are under the influence of mayors  the ratio of female to male workers is reduced for middle management   but increased for top management   in municipalities ruled by female  fig     visual representation of the regression discontinuity design  notes  the underlying population regression function is y  Î±  Î´d   Î²   where y is the response variable  Î± is the intercept  Î´ denotes the systematic difference in y across control and treated units  whereas Î² is the regression slope of the mean centered x scores   j  sieweke and s  santoni the leadership quarterly             mayors  overall  the study applies a sharp rd design to test the causal effect of female leaders on the career opportunities of female followers   the second study is by heck and moriyama    who used a sharp rd design to analyze the indirect relationship between im  provement focused school leadership and student learning outcomes via school instructional practices  the authors exploit the discontinuity which results from a cut off date for students for starting kindergarten  in the study setting  students who were   years old by december   were assigned to the treatment    whereas students who were   years old by december   were assigned to the control group    again  we can argue that near the cut off  the student assignment to the treatment and control groups is as good as random  because parents cannot precisely manipulate the birth date of their children  due to students  nesting within schools  the authors applied a multilevel rd design  the results provide causal evidence for the benefits of one additional year of schooling    the authors further show that the added year of schooling effect is influenced by the effect of improvement focused school leadership on school instructional practices   finally  grÃ¶nqvist and lindqvist   used a fuzzy rd design to analyze how receiving military officer training influences the prob  ability of attaining a civil leadership position  directly testing this re  lationship is difficult as individuals who receive officer training differ from individuals who do not receive the training with regard to ob  servable and unobservable characteristics    to infer the  causal effect of the officer training  grÃ¶nqvist and lindqvist   used discontinuities in test scores as the identification strategy  that is  all individuals who were drafted in the swedish military had to complete a cognitive ability test in which their abilities were ranked according to four dimensions on a scale from     to      although the test score did not determine whether or not a person received the training  it significantly increased the probability of being treated  for instance  receiving the officer training  jumps  from only    of the re  cruits with a score of   to    for recruits with a score of      because of the fuzzy rd design  the authors used two stage least squares to estimate the relationship be  tween receiving officer training and attaining a civil leadership position after the military service  their results indicate that officer training clearly influences the attainment of a civil leadership position  in  dividuals who received the officer training have a    higher like  lihood of attaining a civil leadership position compared to the controls  overall  the study provides causal evidence for the effectiveness of general leadership training   to sum up  the three examples show that both the sharp and the fuzzy rd designs can provide answers to important questions in lea  dership research  the studies were conducted in a variety of contexts   and used very different assignment variables    however  all three studies exploited the almost random assignment of units near the cut off point for causal inference   table   regression discontinuity designs   substantive focus   salient topics   st topic  nd

leadership related disciplines  including economics  business and management  political sciences  and social sciences  suggests that natural experiments are very effective in identifying causal relationships  this section provides some guidelines on further facilitating the use of natural experiments in leadership re  search  the key phases of the research design are presented  starting with the discovery of a natural experiment moving on to the actual form of the natural experiment  and then finishing with the statistical ana  lysis   discovering natural experiments  a major challenge for leadership scholars is to discover natural experiments  unlike laboratory and field experiments  researchers cannot actually design natural experiments  instead  they need to dis  cover contexts in which a random or as if random variation has taken place  discovering these contexts is difficult  for instance  dunning   argues that discovering natural experiments is  as much art as science    we believe a good way to discover natural experiments is by learning from prior examples  firstly  novel research questions can often be answered by re using a known established natural experiment  for example  the natural experiment of the german reunification has been exploited to analyze several research questions  such as the impact of income on health    the transmission of preferences for entrepreneurship from parents to children    or the legitimation of inequality    secondly  even when known established ex  periments may not be perfect for addressing a new research question  by analogical reasoning  researchers can be inspired by such experi  ments and discover more appropriate naturally occurring events for their research question   tables       and   summarize the research questions  exogenous variations  and treatments of each individual study included in our review  regarding standard natural experiments    many studies have exploited the introduction of new laws or regulations  such as a legal reform in sweden that discontinued the conferral of state orders of merit    or new anti takeover legislation    others have used laws that set certain quotas  such as the proportion of women on the boards of norwegian firms    or that reserved leadership positions for members of minorities in randomly selected villages    finally  some studies leverage sudden  exogenous events  such as earthquakes    the successful assassination of political leaders    or the division of germany into two states after       instrumental variables   can be categorized into four main groups  i  macro level variables pertaining to cultural  institu  tional  or societal properties  such as the degree of religious piety within a population   or the ratio of voters in favor of divorce within a region    ii  random or as if random events  such as the gender of a ceo s first born child   or the proportion of a firm s founders that are dead    iii  spatial distance or related variables  e g   the distance of companies from executive recruiting firms   or the existence and intensity of one stop flight connections between the locations of potential director home addresses and firm headquarters    and finally iv  personal or team attributes  such as ceo age and tenure   or board size     concerning the rd design    the highest number of studies focus on the margin of victory in an election as an assignment variable    these studies exploit the fact that in close elections  the assignment of individuals to  the leader position is almost random  ultimately  scholars have discovered natural experiments in a  variety of leadership related contexts and we recommend leadership scholars to analyze whether their research questions can be analyzed using the same natural experiment  furthermore  leadership scholars may focus on current or historical institutional changes   or try to identify contexts in which assignment to training  jobs  or ranks are based on or influenced by a unit s score on an observed variable to identify a new natural experimental context   deciding about the form of the natural experiment  once an exogenous  naturally occurring variation has been dis  covered  scholars need to decide the form of natural experiment to adopt  this choice is key to a design s internal validity as standard natural experiments  iv  and rd designs build on specific assumptions about the mechanisms that are presumed to generate the observed data    our decision tree   is designed to help scholars select the most suitable research design   the first question leadership scholars need to answer concerns the assignment process  is the assignment of units to the treatment truly random   as if random     or non random  although a true ran  domization is a hallmark of laboratory and field experiments    it is seldom found in natural experiments   except for studies that use lotteries     in fact  most natural experiments are characterized by an as if random assignment  the as if random assignment poses some chal  lenges for leadership scholars  because they need to evaluate the quality of the as if randomization  that is  the extent to which it is plausible to assume that the assignment process   resembles a true rando  mization  dunning   recommends assessing the quality of the as if randomization based on three criteria  first  researchers should in  vestigate whether units had information that they would or would not receive the treatment  second  researchers need to check whether units had incentives to self select into the treatment group or control group  third  researchers should analyze whether not only units had incentives but also capacity to self select into a treatment status  for the assess  ment  dunning   suggests using both qualitative evidence   and quantitative evidence     jones and olken    for example  jointly used qualitative and quantitative evidence to evaluate the plausibility of as if randomiza  tion  they used qualitative evidence  such as leaders  biographies  to determine whether the nature of death of political leaders was truly exogenous    at the same time  they provide quantitative evidence  such as the result of a logistic re  gression  to back up the assumption that economic conditions do not predict the death of political leaders   if the assignment process is random or as if random  then re  searchers need to check the second question  are units allowed to change their treatment status  moving from the treatment   to the control   group  this check is important  because units that comply with the assignment   probably differ from units that do not comply with the assignment    for instance  in angrist s   study on the effect of military service on lifetime earnings  subjects were assigned to the treatment   and control group   based on their date of birth and the result of a draft lottery  however  some subjects who were eligible based on the result of the lottery did not serve in the military  because they went to college or moved outside the u s  we can assume that these non compliers differ from the compliers   regarding knowledge  values  attitudes etc   and that these differences are probably correlated with their life  time earnings  therefore  leadership scholars should  if possible  focus  j  sieweke and s

a population     if researchers answer the first question positively   while negatively answering the second one    then the natural experiment at hand re  presents a standard natural experiment  whose data can be analyzed either using neyman s potential outcome framework or by adopting model based adjustments    if both answers are positive  then the natural experiment is an iv design   if the assignment to the treatment is neither random nor as if random  then leadership researchers need to check whether a unit s score on an observed variable influences the assignment  an assignment based on a unit s score on a covariate is a hallmark of the rd design  the assignment may take two forms    first  in the sharp rd design  a unit s score on a covariate determines the assignment  for instance  in the study by arvate et al     the assignment of women to political leadership positions was determined by their share of votes in mayoral elections  second  in the fuzzy rd design  a unit s score on a covariate affects the probability of receiving the treatment  for instance  in grÃ¶nqvist and lindqvist s   study  a person s score on a cognitive test influenced the probability of receiving leadership training   finally  if the assignment to the treatment is not based on a unit s score on an observed variable  then leadership researchers need to determine whether they exploit an exogenous source of variation that they can use to approximate an as if random treatment  if they answer   yes  to the questions  then this exogenous source of variation represents an instrument and the natural experiment can be classified as an iv design  for instance  in the study by bennedsen et al     the hiring of a family ceo versus an external ceo is neither random nor as if random  however  the authors use an exogenous source of variation   the gender of the firstborn child as an instrument to estimate the causal effect of hiring professional managers on firm performance  if re  searchers cannot exploit such an exogenous source of variation  then their context represents a correlational design  which does not support causal inference   analyzing natural experiments  after leadership scholars have determined the form of the natural experiment  they need to analyze the experiment  although the dif  ferent forms may require different types of data analysis  simplicity and transparency are the underlying factors    simplicity means that leadership scholars do not necessarily need to apply com  plex statistical techniques to analyze natural experiment data  a simple difference of means or difference of proportions test is often sufficient to estimate the average causal effect of the treatment  simplicity in data analysis also generally implies greater transparency  for instance  dif  ference of means or difference of percentages tests provide a more transparent estimate of the average causal effect than multivariate re  gression models that contain several covariates  although researchers cannot always follow these principles due to the specific circumstances of a natural experiment and they need to use model based adjustments  such as including covariates or adjusting standard errors  we believe that they should consider the general principles and prefer  simpler  models over more complex ones   analyzing standard natural experiments estimation of the average causal effect in the standard natural experiment  the analysis of standard natural experiments is reasonably simple  since the assignment of units to the treatment is random

causal effect of the treatment on the outcome y  and u represents the error term     plausibility of the assumptions of the standard natural experiment  the analysis of the standard natural experiment using the neyman framework builds on two assumptions  first  units are randomly or as if randomly assigned to the treatment  in order to provide evidence of the quality of the   randomization  dunning   recommends  conducting balance tests  currently  many researchers use mean  difference tests   to analyze variations between units in the treatment and control group along relevant pre treatment covariates  however  this approach is sensitive to the sample size  i e   even small differences become statistically significant if the sample size is large  to reduce this problem  scholars can use normalized differences  which are unaffected by sample size    a further disadvantage of mean difference tests is that it is difficult to determine whether the control and treatment groups are balanced  for instance  if researchers conduct t tests for   covariates  we would expect to find at least one statistically significant difference simply as the result of chance  therefore  we suggest conducting joint hypothesis tests  for example by regressing the binary treatment variable on the covariates and using a Ï  test to analyze whether the coefficient of the covariates differs from zero     second  the neyman framework builds on the assumption that the outcomes of a unit are only influenced by the unit s treatment assign  ment status  this assumption is also called the noninterference as  sumption or the  stable unit treatment value assumption       sutva refers to a situation in which the treatment status of other units affects a unit s outcome  for instance  a company aims to analyze whether leadership training increases the effectiveness of their leaders  for this reason  the company assigns some leaders to a leadership training programme    whereas other leaders receive no training    however  because leaders work together within the same company and interact with each other  leaders in the treatment group may share some of the knowledge they learned in the training programme with leaders in the control group  this spillover violates the sutva and leads to an under  estimated average causal effect    un  fortunately  there is currently no clear solution to sutva violations   fig     decision tree linking treatment attributes  assumptions  and forms of natural experiments   j  sieweke and s  santoni the leadership quarterly             though belloc et al    used corrected standard errors to deal with such possible violations  and selb and munzert   excluded units in the control group which were in close spatial proximity to treated units  because these units were particularly likely to be treated by accident   since there is no  solution  to the sutva violation  we recommend that   both the statistically adjusted and unadjusted estimation results are reported  as this may provide insights into the extent to which a possible sutva violation affects the results  and   the role of social interactions needs to be to explicitly taken into account  which could reveal important boundary conditions for the effect under examination     testing the robustness of the results of the standard natural experiment  there are several options to test the robustness of the results of a standard natural experiment  firstly  the results can be tested for robustness if they include pre treatment covariates in the analysis  for instance  beaman et al    showed the results of both difference in means tests and ordinary least squares coefficients adjusted for covariates despite random assignment of women to a leadership position  although the inclusion of covariates is unlikely to have a high impact on the average causal effect in a natural experiment with high plausibility of as if random assignment  adding covariates   especially those that are unbalanced between the treatment and control group   increases the transparency and credibility of the results in the eyes of other researchers  therefore  the best approach is to estimate the average causal effect with and without covariates and if there are significant differences then potential reasons for these differences should be explored in more detail   secondly  if the passing of a new law  regulation or quota is at the basis of the experiment  then matsa and miller s   approach should be followed  i e   by conducting additional tests for different types of units   e g   units that almost complied with a quota or law before the inception  and units that had a large distance from com  pliance  matsa and miller argue that they would expect greater effects for firms with a greater distance from compliance with the gender quota than for firms that almost complied with the quota  such an additional test is important because it can provide further evidence that the ob  served effect is caused by the new law  regulation  or quota and not by an unrecognized event that affected the units in the treatment group   thirdly  matsa and miller   also use matching methods    matching methods should be used if units in the treatment and control group differ from each other with regard to several   covariates  the covariates can be used to match treated units with control units that are highly similar with regard to the observed covariates  although matching methods are no replace  ment for an as if randomization  because they do not ensure that units in the treatment and control groups do not differ with regard to ob  served and unobserved covariates  these methods can provide further insights into the robustness of the initial results   analyzing instrumental variable designs estimation of the average causal effect in the iv design  in the iv design    we estimate the causal effect of an endogenous treatment variable d by identifying an instrument z that affects d but is otherwise unrelated to the outcome y    the key idea of the iv design is that we only retain the variation in the treatment that is caused by an exogenous variation in the instrument  while ruling out the association between the treatment and possible covariates a and b    for instance  in his study on the effects of military service on future earnings  angrist   isolates the variation in the treatment   that was caused by an exogenous variation   of the instrument     the wald estimator is the simplest and most transparent way to  estimate the average causal effect in the iv design                e y z e y z e d z e d z                               i i i i  i i i i    the iv estimate Ï in eq    equals the difference in the outcome variable between treated e yi zi     and e yi zi     controls divided by the ratio between treated e di zi     and controls e di zi      such an equation provides some first insights into the iv estimate Ï   while the wald estimator should be applied for estimations with a single instrument without any covariates  researchers recommend using the two staged least squares   estimator for multiple instruments or when covariates are added    in the latter case  we use two steps to estimate the causal effect of the treatment  in the first stage     we regress the treatment variable d on a vector of covariates x and on the exogenous instrument z        d x z v       in the second stage     we regress the outcome variable   on the covariates   and predicted values of the treatment from the first stage regression        y x d u        where Î²  denotes the average causal effect of the treatment   evaluation of the plausibility of the assumptions of the iv design  the iv design relies on several assumptions  in line with angrist and pischke    we emphasize the following elements    exogeneity of the instrument    relevance of the instrument  and   the exclusion restriction   the first assumption   exogeneity of the instrument   means that the instrument is uncorrelated with the error term u  included in eq     in other words  the instrument is assumed not to be related to the causes of the dependent variable    arguing this assumption is consistent with a target population regression function  and the dataset at hand is particularly problematic  in fact  it is not possible to empirically test the exogeneity of an instrument    furthermore  recent simulation studies indicate that endogenous instruments produce causal effect estimates  that are inferior to those reported by ols regression     these concerns become less accentuated when units are randomly assigned to the instrument    as in the case of lotteries    even if the assignment is not truly random  one can still argue for the exogeneity of the instrument  for instance  bennedsen et al    point out that their instrument   the gender of the firstborn child   is as if random and they expand on qualitative evidence by observing that technologies to identify the child s gender before the birth were not widespread at the time  so that abortion due to the child s gender was unlikely  these arguments provide convincing evidence for the exogeneity of the instrument  despite the lack of a direct test   the second assumption   the relevance of the instrument   implies that z and d are correlated  specifically  instruments can be categorized into weak  moderate and strong according to the magnitude of the z d correlation  in order to assess an instrument s strength  the canonical test can be used which is based on the f statistic of the first stage re  gression     exploiting the canonical test  olea and pflueger   developed a weak instrument test  which is robust to heteroscedasticity  autocorrelation  and clustering  and which is more efficient than the standard stock and yogo   test  strong instruments should be the norm in the iv design  because weak and    please note that assumptions  and   are often combined  in the interest of clarity  we follow angrist and pischke   and separately consider each assumption     interested readers find an overview of critical values for the weak instru  ment test in stock and yogo     j  sieweke and s  santoni the leadership quarterly             moderate instruments lead to inflated standard errors  although the estimated regression slopes are unbiased     the third assumption   exclusion restriction   means that z has no influence on y apart from the effect that is conveyed through d    similarly to the exogeneity assumption  the exclusion restriction cannot be assessed based on the available data  in fact  it cannot be proved that the instrument   even when it results from a true randomization   does not affect the dependent variable through alter  native causal pathways    instead  the best approach would be to    critically analyze possible theoretical me  chanisms through which the instrument may be related to the depen  dent variable  and   provide both logical arguments and qualitative evidence that help to rule those mechanisms out     testing the robustness of the resultsof the iv design  leadership scholars have at least two alternatives to assess the robustness of an iv design s results  first  estimated regression slopes could be compared across models building on alternative instruments  for instance  chintrakarn et al    use the degree of religious adherence in the population surrounding a firm s corporate headquarters in   as instrument in their main analyses  then  they provide a second model using a twenty  year lag of the original instrument   second  sometimes the instrument influences the assignment to the treatment  whereas it does not capture the timing of the treatment  for instance  bennedsen et al    explained that observed differences in firm performance between firms with a family ceo and firms with an outside ceo may also result from differences in the timing of ceo succession    therefore  the authors check their initial results by estimating the model on a sub  sample of the data   i e   the instances in which the ceo transition occurred while the incumbent ceo is in the  normal  retirement age  they even identified an additional instrument  ceo death  to test whether their findings are robust when the timing of ceo succession is credibly exogenous  these rigorous robustness checks help to rule out alternative explanations for the observed relationships and strengthen the causal inference   analyzing regression discontinuity designs estimation of the average causal effect  before starting to analyze the regression discontinuity design  leadership researchers need to check whether the natural experiment represents a sharp or a fuzzy regression discontinuity design  the sharp rd design is characterized by a perfect compliance of the units  that is  all units above the threshold receive the treatment and all units below the threshold are assigned to the control group    in the fuzzy rd design  not all units with a score above the threshold receive the treatment  instead  a score above the threshold merely influences the probability that a unit will receive the treatment    our discussion in this section focuses on the sharp rd design  because the fuzzy rd design has already been discussed in the section   analyzing instrumental variable designs     the analysis of the sharp rd design follows the principles of sim  plicity and transparency    as shown in fig     we re  quire two variables for the analysis  x and x   x represents the as  signment variable and xi represents the score of unit i on the assignment variable  x  denotes the threshold or cut off point for the assignment of the treatment  based on xi and x   we can create a binary treatment variable  td  that equals   if xi    x  and   if xi   x      the treatment variable is crucial for determining the discontinuity  the  regression model for the rd design is shown in eq             y td x x u i i    the crucial quantity of interest is the treatment effect  td  the coefficient Î´ indicates the discontinuity at the threshold    which represents the average causal effect of the treatment    the coefficient Î² represents the continuous effect of the assignment variable  which is centered around the value of the threshold x   re  searchers suggested that the slope of the regression should be allowed to differ between the control group and the treatment group   by including an interac  tion between the treatment variable and the assignment variable as shown in eq               y td x x td x x u   i i i    the coefficient Ï represents the interaction between the assignment variable and the treatment assignment and indicates whether the slope differs between the control group and the treatment group   evaluation the plausibility of the assumptions of the rd design  compared to the instrumental variable design and the standard natural experiment design  the rd design is based on mild assumptions    the crucial assumption underlying the rd design is that units cannot precisely manipulate their score on the assignment variable    because it ensures that units close to the threshold are almost randomly assigned to the treatment and the control condition  this assumption cannot be directly validated  however  leadership scholars can conduct various tests that may falsify the assumption  for instance  arvate et al    tested   the balance on covariates between units closely below and above the threshold  and   the density of the assignment variable   firstly  testing the balance on pre treatment covariates between units closely below and above the threshold provides insights into the quality of the as if randomization  if units cannot precisely manipulate their score on the assignment variable  we would expect that units closely above the threshold do not systematically differ from units closely below the threshold with regard to pre treatment covariates    the balance test as described for the standard natural experiment can be used to test the plausibility of the as if randomization  although we suggest using different band  widths around the threshold to check the robustness of the test  lea  dership scholars should consider that observations in the treatment and control group with a greater distance from the threshold will be more likely to differ from each other than observations close to the threshold   secondly  to further check the assumption that units were not able to precisely manipulate their score on the assignment variable  mccrary s   test can be carried out  the test assumes that if units have imprecise control over their score  we would expect to find that the density of the assignment variable would be continuous  con  versely  a jump in the density around the threshold could be a sign of a unit s ability to manipulate the assignment variable    together  the results of these two tests can help leadership scholars to provide evidence for the validity of the identifying assumption in the rd design   testing the robustness of the results of the rd design  a further important step in the rd design is to check the robustness of the results given that various decisions may affect the size of the average causal effect  specifically  three decisions have received considerable attention in the literature    the inclusion of covariates    the selection of the bandwidth  and   the inclusion of higher order polynomials   first  leadership researchers need to decide whether they should include covariates in the analysis  in rd designs  the inclusion of cov  ariates is not as straightforward as in correlational studies  due to the as if random assignment of units into treatment and control groups near the threshold  a consistent estimate of the discontinuity can still be    please note that the fuzzy rd design resembles an instrumental variable design in which the assignment variable is the instrument     j  sieweke and s  santoni the leadership quarterly             obtained without including covariates    never  theless  the current consensus is that covariates should be included in rd designs   especially if covariates are discontinuously distributed at the cut off of the assignment variable   because they may reduce var  iance and eliminate bias in the average causal effect     we recommend scholars to estimate the average causal effect both with and without covariates  in a  strong  rd design  the difference in the average causal effect in both settings should be minimal given the as if random assignment  yet  including covariates may provide insights into the robustness of the results and is especially recommended if the whole range of observations is included  i e  even observations far away from the threshold     second  leadership researchers need to select a bandwidth  i e   a range of values around the threshold that should be included in the analysis  selecting the bandwidth is a crucial decision  because the re  sults are often sensitive to the bandwidth    larger bandwidths have the advantage of reducing the variance in the coefficient of the discontinuity  because of the use of more observations  whereas smaller bandwidths reduce the likelihood of mis specifying the local polynomial     although in most empirical contexts there is no  objective  band  width  there are  however  several statistical approaches for selecting an optimal bandwidth    whatever statistical approach or bandwidth se  lection criteria  we strongly recommend following imbens and lemieux   and testing the sensitivity of findings in relation to different bandwidth choices    this approach will reveal the level of robustness of the average causal effect and may increase the credibility of the findings     thirdly  researchers debate the use of higher order polynomials of the assignment variable in rd designs  some studies include high order polynomials   of the assignment variable in the regression to smoothen the regression function    however  gelman and imbens   argue against this practice   unless there are strong theory based reasons   because estimates become noisier and the results are sensitive to the choice of the high order polynomials  instead  they recommend using local low  order polynomials   in rd designs  which have a much lower variation in the estimates  we recommend the approach described by lee and lemieux    who suggest analyzing the ro  bustness of the average causal effect to changes in the inclusion of higher order polynomials both for a small and wide window around the threshold  again  this approach provides further insights into the ro  bustness of the findings and may increase the credibility of the rd design   in addition to checking the robustness of the rd results for the three decisions  two types of placebo tests are also worth conducting  first  placebo cut off tests check for a discontinuity at cut off points where no treatment should have been assigned  finding a discontinuity at a placebo cut off may indicate confounding effects in the rd design  to test for the presence of multiple treatments  imbens and lemieux    found a good approach by splitting their sample into two sub  samples  sub sample   includes all observations on the left of the initial cut off point    sub sample   includes all observations on the right of x   in each sub sample  scholars should use the median value of the assignment variable as the placebo cut off  as this approach maximizes statistical power  the same regression function can be used to run the placebo test as shown in equation    in this case  however  td  which represents the placebo treatment variable  ideally does not differ from zero in either of the sub samples  which would indicate that no dis  continuity is found at the placebo cut off point   concluding remarks  identifying causal relationships is becoming increasingly important for leadership scholars and experimental designs play a key role in this endeavor    the aim of this paper was to complement the recent experimental turn in leadership research by introducing natural ex  perimental designs and discussing their potential for inferring causal relationships in leadership research   although this paper focuses on the potential of natural experiments and their implementation  it is also important to discuss some limita  tions    first  a natural experiment is only as good as the plausibility of the as if ran  domization  if the as if randomization is plausible  we can assume that the internal validity of a natural experiment is almost as high as the internal validity of a laboratory or field experiment  however  if the as  if randomization is not plausible  then the internal validity of a natural experiment is rather low  therefore  leadership scholars need to criti  cally evaluate the quality of the as if randomization   based on quantitative and qualitative evidence     second  although natural experiments take place in a natural field setting  which guarantees their ecological validity  the external validity of natural experiments could be open to question  often  the setting of a natural experiment is unique  or the interventions apply to a very specific group  which poses the question as to whether the findings can be generalized to other populations in other contexts    to overcome this limitation  natural experiments can be combined with observational studies   finally  we need to emphasize that a  good  natural experiment is no replacement for a  good  research question  that is  leadership scholars need to consider that a natural experiment is just a tool to infer causal relationships  it is not an end in itself   to sum up  the aim of this paper was to introduce the natural ex  perimental design to leadership research  although we have tried to cover important parts of the literature regarding natural experiments  we urge scholars interested in applying a natural experiment to ad  ditionally consult the literature on the specific design    we hope that this paper will stimulate the use of natural experiments in leadership research and will be a useful addition to the  experimental tool box  of leadership scho  lars   appendix a  retrieved set of studies  the set of exhibits included in this appendix a provides some descriptive

several steps    in the first step  we use the python library spacy to pre process the data  specifically  we perform the following set of string manipulations   â¢ tokenization   sentences involved in the   abstracts are segmented into words  numbers  punctuation  â¢ lemmatization   base form of a word are applied  for example  the lemma of  had  is  have   â¢ token removal   numbers and stop words   are filtered out   in the second step  we leverage the python library gensim to create the input for the topic model  namely the dictionary   and the corpus     in the third step  we use mallet software to estimate a set of competing topic models  each of which retains a unique number of topics    we set the maximum number of topics equal to the number of categories included in gardner et al     considering the internal validity of the various models   and the coherence score   a statistical metrics that expresses the face validity of the inductively derived topics     we retain the model with ten topics  the pattern of topics associated with the best fitting model is shown in fig     the left hand side of the chart employs multidimensional scaling to offer a low di  mensional representation of the relationships among the eleven topics  the right hand side of the visualization reports the set of the thirty most salient terms involved in the topic model  the live version of this visualization   available in html format as supplemental materials   provides additional insights regarding the pairing structure linking terms and topics  for example  the set of the most salient terms changes as one moves the cursor over the bullets associated with the topics   finally  we use the topic model trained with mallet to characterize each of the   studies included in
